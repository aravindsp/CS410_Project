 Verbotene Liebe (19952015)Summaries Television series circling around young people, friends and families in Cologne and Dsseldorf, Germany. The series' trademark is that it tells both about life in rich (such as Dukes and Duchesses) as well as "normal" families and people. Other and maybe most important trademark is that there always is one or many cases of forbidden love ("Verbotene Liebe"), such as homosexuality or adultery.
