Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. Set in the early sixties, THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE follows the misadventures of Dr. Bill Cortner (Patrick Green), a brilliant surgeon, whose unorthodox practices produce fantastic results - the reanimation of dead tissue. Bill's father and mentor, William, cautions his son against meddling with the forces of nature, but Bill insists that his work will bring an end to human mortality. Bill's methods are put to the test when his fiancee, Jan Compton (Rachael Perrell Fosket), is decapitated in a car accident. Absconding with her remains to his secret laboratory, Bill successfully revives Jan's head in a pan. She begs for death but Bill refuses to oblige, promising that he can make her whole again. Putting his assistant, Kurt (Jason Reynolds), in charge of the lab, Bill leaves to find Jan a new body, knowing full well that he will have to murder an innocent woman to do so. Bill's quest takes him through the seedy underbelly of the city, from smoky cabarets to sleazy swimsuit competitions. Despite his efforts, Bill is foiled at every turn, narrowly avoiding the suspicions of Mancini (Robert Blanche), the hardboiled detective investigating the car accident. However, Bill's luck changes when he chances upon an old flame, Doris Powell (Mia Allen), a vulnerable model with surgical needs. Meanwhile, Jan, determined to bring an end to the madness, uses her newly discovered psychic abilities to communicate with another of Bill's hideously deformed experiments. Together, they plot their revenge...

This will not be easy for Carl, as a lot of his shipmates and even his trainer Master Chief Billy Sunday wants to see that he fails and quits. It will take all of Carl's strength, endurance and determination to win the respect of his fellow Sailors and make history. John Wiggins Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. The movie starts off by introducing Master Chief Leslie W. ("Billy") Sunday (Robert DeNiro), a US Navy Diver, who has recently gone AWOL. He is badly beaten and awaiting disciplinary actions. Sunday and several other Navy members watch TV coverage of an ongoing salvage operation, when Sunday recognizes a familiar face on the screen. One of the other sailors makes some crude racist jokes, Sunday attacks him and applies a choke hold. We then flash back about 25 years, where a young African-American boy named Carl Brashear (Chris Warren Jr.) is watching his father Mac (Carl Lumbly) work the plow on their farm. Carl wants to quit school so that he will be able to help work and then prevent the farm from financial ruin. Mac is dead-set against his son being "like him" and stuck working on a farm, but he allows Carl to help. Time passes quickly and a grown-up Carl (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is leaving town to join the Navy. Mac gives his son a custom-built portable radio as a memento of home, and tells Carl to be the best, even if it means breaking the rules. Carl winds up working in the kitchens on the USS Hoist in the South Pacific. He and the other black officers joke about the so-called "bright future" the Navy promised them. Their superior points out that black men in the US Navy have only 3 career choices- cook, officer's valet or "get the f*ck out of the Navy." Afterwards, Carl and his friends go up on deck where the white officers are swimming (the black crew members are assigned a specific day when they can swim). Carl, tired and hot, decides to jump in the water. The white officers try and chase him down, but Carl out-swims all of them. Carl's actions get him thrown in the brig. The ships' captain meets with Carl and, impressed with the boy's speed, decides to transfer Carl to the search & rescue swimmers, a group assigned to rescue anyone who falls overboard on ship. A few days later, Carl is writing a letter home to his parents when the ship is rocked by an apparent crash. Their mail chopper has accidentally gone down in the ocean. Carl assists the others on deck in raising a Navy Diver from the sea floor with the wounded pilot. The Diver is Master Chief Sunday. Since Sunday is now back up on deck, regulations state that he must now undergo decompression. As the next diver is lowered, an accident with the winch severs the diver's air hose. Chief Sunday prepares to do a dangerous "bounce dive" to rescue his fallen ally. One officer, Lt. Cmdr Hanks (David Conrad) orders Sunday not to go, but Sunday disobeys and jumps off ship. Later in the hospital, we see that Chief Sunday was indeed able to save the other diver, but doctors find that he has sustained a severe embolism in both lungs. This condition disqualifies Sunday from any more diving. Upon hearing this news, Sunday throws a fit, destroying some equipment in the hospital, and assaulting several of the staff. Carl is in attendance at the resulting disciplinary hearing, where Sunday is officially disqualified from further diving duty, and assigned to a training position. Carl, having seen Sunday's actions as heroic, is inspired and vows to become a Navy Master Diver. Two years later, Carl is reporting for Diving School, the same diving school where Sunday is the trainer. After a tense confrontation with Chief Sunday, he is allowed in. While most other recruits are revolted by the thought of sharing their bunk with a Negro, one Navy candidate- Snowhill (Michael Rapaport) attempts to befriend Carl. That night, Carl is subjected to severe hazing by Sunday. The following morning, Chief Sunday singles out Snowhill, throwing him out of the program for failing to complete an impossible task. His only ally alienated, Carl is once again on his own. Despite the harsh treatments, Carl performs admirably in his training, assembling machinery and adapting to the diving suit with much greater results than a large number of his classmates. Unfortunately, Carl is falling behind in the academic requirements-scoring only a 37 on his first exam. If he fails again, Carl will be kicked out of the program. One weekend, on leave, Carl comes to a library in the hopes of getting a tutor to help him. He meets a young woman named Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) who is studying medicine. She thinks that Carl cannot possibly succeed, since he has only a 7th grade education. Carl stays the entire night at the library reading and learning more about the Navy program. Next morning, Jo is so impressed by his progress that she agrees to help Carl. The two spend many evenings together, eventually developing a relationship in the process. Soon, Carl is back in the classroom awaiting the results of another test. As the exams are passed out, Carl is elated- he's scored a 76, keeping him in the program. The next day there is a training exercise, involving patching the hole in a sunken ship and raising it to the surface. All at once, the ship accidentally shifts its position, snaring the air hose on one diver while the other flees for his life. Carl volunteers to bring down a new line for the trapped diver, and after several tense seconds, Carl is able to save the young mans' life. Unfortunately, due to the prejudiced environment of the time, the diver who fled earlier receives a medal for his actions while Carl is ignored. Carl is, however, silently thanked by the recruit he saved on his way out of the school. That night, Carl is in town when he meets a young woman (Charlize Theron) who introduces herself as Gwen Sunday, the chief's wife. Gwen takes Carl into the same bar her husband and his fellow divers frequent. Carl and Sunday confront each other, whereby Carl says he knows he's better than Sunday. They face off in a competition using pressurized diving helmets to determine who can hold their breath the longest. The stakes are if Sunday wins, Carl leaves town that very night, but if Carl wins, Chief Sunday must re-admit Snowhill into the diving program. Carl manages to win, but is again overlooked for his actions. Carl sees Jo watching the confrontation with dismay as she storms out of the bar. He gives chase, and she reveals that she's been accepted into an internship and she won't have time to help Carl anymore. Carl, smitten, asks Jo to marry him. Jo contemplates driving off in a taxi, but she returns and accepts. Chief Sunday meets with Captain "Pappy," (Hal Holbrook), the eccentric senior officer at the training school. Chief Sunday states that Carl has scored a 94 on his final test, meaning that all Carl has to do is complete his last training exercise (a timed exercise), and he will have passed all requirements for graduation. Pappy is not at all happy at the prospect of a "colored diver," but Sunday seems hesitant to agree. Sunday confronts Carl yet again. After Carl fires an insult back, Sunday smashes the radio Carl's father gave him. Upon seeing Carl's fury at this, Sunday sees the inscription no the radio ASNF (a son never forgets), and Carl's father's picture by his bed. Sunday asks what his father said to make him try so hard. Carl simply states "Be the best." Sunday admits that he is, but that he shouldn't show up the following day because Pappy will not let him pass the school. Carl is furious. Next morning, Chief Sunday explains the final exercise to the recruits- they must assemble a flange underwater, pieces are on the river bottom and tools will be provided once the parts are found. They will earn points based on the speed of their work, but there is no set time limit and air will be provided to the diving suits for as long as the divers can stand the cold water. Carl makes a defiant entrance to the exercise, and is looked upon with a measure of respect from the other recruits finally. Carl is among the first to find the parts for his project, but when he calls up for tools the attendants cut a hole in the tool bag sending them cascading all over the river bottom. Carl frantically searches for all the necessary parts. As time goes by, the recruits slowly but surely complete the assignment. Carl remains in the water well into the night. The other recruits, having showered and put on warm clothes, have returned to see Carl finish. Pappy orders Sunday to leave Carl in the water until he stops moving. Sunday, however, decides that too much time has passed already and gives the order to bring Carl back up. This makes Sunday's colleagues uneasy, as it violates a direct order from Pappy. The other recruits step up, but just as they begin to haul in the lines, Carl's project flange comes to the surface, completed. After 9 hours and 31 minutes in the excruciatingly cold water, Carl Brashear has passed his final and essentially graduated with honors from Diving School. As Carl leaves the barracks next day, Snowhill runs in to talk to him. He has been asked to rejoin the diving program. He also states that Pappy has thrown Sunday out of the school as trainer. Carl also finds his father's radio, fully repaired, with "A son never forgets" freshly carved into the side. Some time later, Carl and his wife are in a nightclub. Carl orders champagne as a celebration because he's been offered a job with Brooklyn Navy Yard. Carl doesn't know if he should accept the job, since he won't move up in rank as just a stand-by diver. Jo confesses that she is three months late, and Carl is suddenly overjoyed at the prospect of being a father. At a New Years' party, Sunday and his wife run into Lt. Hanks- the man who ended Sunday's diving career. Despite his best efforts to remain civil, Sunday ends up attacking the lieutenant. Charges are filed against Sunday for assaulting a superior officer, and he suffers a rank reduction. The scene then shifts back to Chief Sunday watching a TV report explaining the current salvage operations. Earlier that day, an American B-52 bomber crashed in Spain. Before impact, it released its payload of three 50-megaton warheads on parachutes. Two have been recovered but the last one is lost at sea. Furthermore, maritime law dictates that since the bomb vanished in international waters, whoever finds it first will be considered the true owner. So the US Divers are racing against Russian submarines to be the first to find the missing nuke. Carl is one of several divers assigned to try and find the missing bomb. At one point, Carl finds a metal object on the sea floor but it turns out to be a mere Coke can. At that moment, sonar signals in the water are detected- there is a Russian submarine is Carls' immediate vicinity. Carl spots the sub and tries to run for cover, but his air line is caught by the sub and he is dragged along the ocean floor. After several tense seconds, Carl is able to contact the surface and tell them that he is unhurt. As they prepare to bring him home, Carl notices a large metal object nearby. The sub's movement has caused most of the silt and debris on the ocean floor to move aside, essentially finding the nuke for them! Back on deck, Carl watches as the bomb is brought on board. An accident with the winch on deck causes the lines holding the bomb to snap. Carl shoves several other deck hands aside, but his own leg is caught by the snapped wire. Carl wakes up later in a hospital, with Jo by his side. Jo explains that Carl's leg was nearly severed by the impact, but doctors think he will walk again. Carl realizes that this injury has put an end to his diving career and he is devastated. Meanwhile, Chief Sunday has fallen on hard times since his rank reduction. He is now in a rehab clinic undergoing detox for alcoholism. With the support of his wife, Sunday gets back on his feet. He recognizes Carl from a news story about the accident. Carl is still in the hospital, he is reading a news story that was sent to him (presumably by Sunday) about amputee pilots being able to return to duty. He speaks with his superiors (including the now-Captain Hanks). Carl wants to return to full diving duty, but they feel that it is impossible in his current state. Carl voices his desire to have the damaged leg amputated and return after a fitting with a prosthesis. Jo is furious about Carl's reckless and apparently selfish attitude, and walks out. Later, Carl's leg is indeed amputated. He begins the difficult process of learning to move and act with a prosthetic. Chief Sunday shows up and asks if he can help Carl. Sunday begins training him again, and makes a deal with Captain Hanks. He will get four weeks to complete training Carl before a medical hearing with the Chief of Naval Personnel in Washington. Hanks agrees, on the condition that Sunday take immediate retirement if and when Carl fails to return to duty. A month later, Carl appears before the Naval Personnel and they discuss his possible return. Chief Sunday has been ordered to wait outside the courtroom by Captain Hanks. Captain Hanks outlines a new requirement for Navy Divers- a new diving suit, weighing in at 290 pounds has been approved for use and anyone wanting to use it must take 12 steps unassisted. Carl, seeing that Jo and his son are in the audience, volunteers to take the 12 steps right then and there. Chief Sunday bursts into the courtroom. He is asked to leave by Hanks, but after introducing himself to some of the more senior members of the court who know of his past heroics, is allowed to stay. Chief Sunday helps Carl suit up, and then proceeds to coach him through the ordeal. Carl stands up in the new suit, and-with obvious great discomfort- takes a few clumsy steps forward. Everyone assumes that his prosthetic will snap, and as he nears failure he is ordered to stand down by Captain Hanks. Sunday orders Carl to disregard, as he is the officer in charge of this exercise. He begins shouting orders at Carl (identical to their first session at diving school years before). Carl struggles, but keeps moving forward until he has reached the twelfth step. Captain Hanks, realizing that no more can be done to prevent Carl from succeeding, announces that the Navy will be reinstating Carl Brashear to full diving duty. Carl and Sunday salute one another, and Sunday marches out of the courtroom. Text at the end reveals that in 1968, Carl Brashear was the first African-American amputee to assume Navy diving duty, and that two years after his reinstatement Carl was promoted to Master Chief. Carl continued in his Naval career for another nine years before finally taking retirement. 
 World Trade Center (2006)541) Two Port Authority police officers become trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center. On September, 11th 2001, after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center, the building collapses over the rescue team from the Port Authority Police Department. Will Jimeno and his sergeant John McLoughlin are found alive trapped under the wreckage while the rescue teams fight to save them. Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On the quiet but fateful day of September 11, 2001, the officers of New York City's Port Authority, Sergeant John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno, received an emergency call. But, as they tried to evacuate the building after the sudden and devastating attack on the World Trade Center towers by massive airliners piloted by terrorists, McLoughlin and Jimeno found themselves trapped inside the crippled skyscraper. As two of the last people found alive in the wreckage, both McLoughlin and Jimeno fought tooth and nail to cling to their lives, hoping that the rescuers, who combed through the debris, and their worried spouses--Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno--would never lose hope and abandon them. In the face of calamity, the city and an entire nation refused to give in to fear. Will the world ever be the same again after 9/11? Nick Riganas In the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster, hope is still alive. Refusing to bow down to terrorism, rescuers and family of the victims press forward. Their mission of rescue and recovery is driven by the faith that under each piece of rubble, a co-worker, a friend a family member may be found. This is the true story of John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno, two of the last survivors extracted from Ground Zero and the rescuers who never gave up. It's a story of the true heroes of that fateful time in the history of the United States when buildings would fall and heroes would rise, literally from the ashes to inspire the entire human race. JJ Brent (jjbrentmusic@yahoo.com) Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. On September 11, 2001, Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, who are patrolling the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, see a plane fly dangerously low overhead. As all of the police officers return to the station, they take a glimpse at the TV, and find that the North Tower of the World Trade Center has been hit by a plane. Sergeant McLoughlin assigns many of the officers to assist in an evacuation attempt of the (still undamaged) South Tower, and they board a commandeered Metropolitan Transit Authority bus. On the bus, they hear reports that the South Tower has also been hit. When they arrive at the site of the World Trade Center, they realize the extent of the disaster and see one of the first victims to jump out of the towers to certain death. As Jimeno drops off their police equipment in 5 World Trade Center, officers proceed to get safety equipment and enter the concourse between the towers. The group consists of McLoughlin, Jimeno, Dominick Pezzulo, and Antonio Rodrigues. An officer named Chris Amoroso appears to inform them of other events, such as the attack on the Pentagon and the second plane's hit on the South Tower, though the group does not accept this. As the men prepare to enter the North Tower, the buildings begin to rumble. McLoughlin realizes that the South Tower is collapsing onto them and that their only chance of survival is to run into the service elevator shaft. Chris trips and does not have time to get up. Rodrigues is unable to get to the shaft in time. McLoughlin, Jimeno and Pezzulo manage to escape the huge amounts of dust and rubble flying down from the South Tower. However, as the rubble continues to crush the elevator shaft, the three are trapped. As the cascade of debris subsides, Pezzulo realizes he can free himself and manages to move nearer to Jimeno who, along with McLoughlin, is pinned under rubble and cannot move. Pezzulo tries but fails to shift the debris covering Jimeno's legs and is told by McLoughlin not to leave. As Pezzulo becomes optimistic that they will live, the rumbling begins again as the North Tower starts to collapse as well. Although Jimeno and McLoughlin are not further harmed, Pezzulo is fatally wounded. After he fires a gun through a gap in the rubble to try to alert rescuers to their position, he dies. Jimeno and McLoughlin spend hours under the rubble, in pain but exchanging personal information. McLoughlin is particularly anxious to keep Jimeno from falling asleep, and Jimeno also realizes that by straining to grab a metal bar above his body, he can make a noise that rescuers might hear. Two United States Marines, Dave Karnes and Marine Sergeant Thomas, who are searching for survivors in the rubble of what was once the World Trade Center, do hear it and find the men, calling for help to dig them out. Jimeno is rescued first, and then hours later McLoughlin is lifted out of the debris, barely alive. They are then both reunited with their distraught families at the hospital. 
 Rose Red (2002)431) A group of people with psychic powers are invited to spend the night in a haunted house. Dr. Joyce Reardon, a psychology professor, leads a team of psychics into the decrepit mansion known as Rose Red. Her efforts unleash the spirit of former owner Ellen Rimbauer and uncover the horrifying secrets of those who lived and died there. Gizele A group of people with psychic powers are invited to awake a sleeping giant that is Rose Red. But as their stay grows longer, they find that not only have they awoken Rose Red, they've unleased a power that will doom them all... Wesley Neskora <wneskora_88> Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. Red Rose is Stephen King's take on the often repeated story of an academic taking a group of people into a haunted house to see what makes it tick and then suddenly bad things start to happen. In this case the house is an early 20th Century behemoth in Seattle named "Red Rose" built by industrialist John P. Rimbauer ( John Procaccino ) for his new wife Ellen( Julia Campbell ). In a flashback, we see that while the house was under construction John takes Ellen on a world tour. When she gets deathly sick in Africa, Ellen is nursed back to heath by local woman, Sukeena ( Tsidii Leloka ), who Ellen brings back with her as her maid to the couple's new home in Seattle. Red Rose seems like it has a bad nature from the beginning. A foreman is murdered during construction and Ellen and John's five year-old daughter mysteriously disappears without a trace. Later John himself commits suicide by throwing himself out a window at the top of Red Rose's tallest tower. Over the years a number of men are killed in the house and a larger number of women simply disappear. Ellen continues to add rooms to the rambling mansion throughout her life until she also disappears mysteriously in 1950s. The Rimbauer family continues to own the house, though their fortunes decline and they are forced to support it with public tours until too many of the tourists go mysteriously missing on the property. The film story starts properly in modern times when our academic, Professor Joyce Reardon, ( Nancy Travis ), decides that she is going to use Red Rose to prove that psychic phenomena is real. She is dating Steve Rimbauer ( Matt Keeslar ), the last of the family. He has decided to tear the place down and put up condos, but he will let Joyce have a weekend to prove her theories before the wrecking ball moves in on it. Reardon thinks that by bringing a collection of psychically active people to the house she can reactive what she calls a "dead cell" and get the readings she needs on her scientific equipment to prove her theories. To that end she recruits Emery Waterman ( Matt Ross ), Cathy Kramer ( Judith Ivey ), Nick Hardaway ( Julian Sands ), Victor Kandinsky ( Kevin Tighe ) and Pam Asbury ( Emily Deschanel ) to go with her and Steve to the house for the weekend. Each member of the party has a different psychic ability. Emery, in particular, is terrified by the house. He is having frightening visions about it even before leaving his home. However, he is broke and needs the $5,000 Reardon will pay him to keep him and his overbearing mother financially afloat. Despite Reardon's impressive collection of psychics, who she really wants most is a 15 year-old autistic girl named Annie Wheaton ( Kimberly J. Brown ) who has tremendous powers of telekinesis (as a five year-old she plummeted a neighbor's house with boulders after their dog bit her). Annie's father refuses to let her participate, but her older sister, Rachael ( Melanie Lynskey ), sneaks her into the group when Reardon agrees to pay for Annie's tuition at a special school for children like her. Reardon's plans are also plagued by her department head, Professor Carl Miller ( David Dukes ), who thinks her expedition is embarrassment to the college and a waste of time as Red Rose is not haunted. He tries to get her tenure revoked and in service of this goal he sends college newspaper reporter Kevin Bollinger ( Jimmi Simpson ) into the house before the team arrives to get some embarrassing pictures of them involved in their "spook hunt." Miller is quite wrong about the house, however, as Bollinger finds out when he is let into the house by Sukeena (who he does not realize is a ghost). He dies soon after in the conservatory. We later see his body hanging in the library. Reardon's team arrives, gets to know each other, and settles in for the night. Pam is the first to die as she leaves her bedroom in the dark and is drawn to a fountain in the backyard and drowns. Her ghost later leads Victor into the backyard where the vision of a statue of Ellen Rimbauer coming to life gives him a heart attack. Sick, he returns to the house where Emory refuses to let him in thinking he is another of his visions. Victor dies just outside the house. When the group tries to retrieve the body, they realize that the doors are locked and the widows have become shatterproof. Steve, finding a cell phone in the conservatory that he realizes must have been given to Bollinger by Miller, calls Miller telling him Bollinger is dead and that before he died he wrote Miller's name in blood on a wall (This is a lie as Steve has no idea of Bollinger's fate). However, it brings Miller to the house in a panic. Also Emory's mother can't get a hold of him by phone and being incredibly possessive of him, she drives to the house to find him. Annie has become fascinated with a doll house version of Red Rose on a high shelf. She attempts to reach it, but falls, knocking herself out. During the period she is unconscious Emory realizes that all the doors have become unlocked and comes to the conclusion that the house is using Annie's powerful abilities to keep them trapped. Unfortunately before he can escape, she re-awakes and the front door slams on the fingers of his left hand cutting them off. In pain and being affected by the evil atmosphere of the house, Emory suggests knocking Annie out, or killing her so they can make their escape. The rest of the group are horrified at the idea, but do come to realize that they need to get to Annie's mind (blocked to them by the house) to ask her to open the doors so they can get away before the house kills them. Miller and Emory's mother arrive at the same time and have a minor accident in the drive. The house seems to push Emory's mothers mind past the breaking point and she goes running through the grounds screaming for him chased by Miller. They later get separated and Miller is killed, though we dont see how. Cathy goes to the kitchen to get something to drink where she runs into Emory's mother and the unhinged woman attacks her. Fortunately, Nick has followed Cathy and they manage to tie the crazed woman up. They head back to the rest of the group to tell what has happened, but are chased down the hall by a spook. Nick pushes Cathy though a door to safety, but is killed by the ghost. Back in the kitchen the ghost of Sukeena and Ellen drag Emory's mother away and kill her. Cathy finally makes her way back to the group. Along the way she has had a vision and realizes that John Rimbauer's death was not a suicide, but he was murdered by Ellen and Sukeena because he broke Ellen's heart with his infidelities. Steve reaches the conclusion that Cathy may be able to get to Annie's mind by use of her skill: automatic writing. Giving a pen to both Annie and Cathy they both start writing. Cathy repeats a message to open the doors and soon Annie starts writing it too. The message finally get to Annie's mind and amid the wild protestations of the house the doors and windows are blown open. The group tries to leave, but Reardon, now obsessed with having scientific proof of this physic phenomena, refuses to go. The group is forced to leave her behind. On the way out the ghost of Emory's mother tries to detain him, but for the first time in his life he gets up the strength to tell her no. Ellen also tries to stop her great grandson, Steve, from leaving by asking him to stay and help her continue to build the house, but he refuses. Outside in safety Annie sends boulders down on the evil house, just as she did when she was a kid. Inside Reardon finds herself surrounded by ghosts: Ellen , Sukeena, Miller, Bollinger, Nick, Kandinsky Emory's mother and Pam. As they close in on her she dies. The action jumps forward six months and we see the survivors return the day before the house is to be knocked down. They leave seven red roses in the drive in honor of the people they lost. As they drive away we see the ghosts of Ellen, Sukeena and Reardon watching them from the tower window.
