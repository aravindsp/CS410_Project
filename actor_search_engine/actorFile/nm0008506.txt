Anne Campbell In 1928, smalltime magician Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) seeks out the successful magician Wei Ling Soo, a.k.a. Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth), in Berlin, Germany. They have been friends since childhood and Howard invites Stanley to travel to the south of France to expose American clairvoyant Sophie Baker (Emma Stone), who has convinced the matriarch of the wealthy Catledge family and her son Brice Catledge (Hamish Linklater) that she is legitimate. Brice has proposed to her to get married. Englishman Stanley is an arrogant, rational, and bitter man, and he leaves his fiance Olivia (Catherine McCormack) in England and travels to France to visit his Aunt Vanessa (Dame Eileen Atkins) and to meet Sophie and disclose her swindle. When Stanley meets Sophie, he is spellbound by her smile and big eyes. Stanley also learns that Sophie comes from a very poor family and now has the chance to marry a millionaire. He uses Howard to help him to find her trick, but soon he is convinced that Sophie is a real medium, shaking up his principles of rationality and belief. Further, he falls in love with her. He decides to call a press conference to tell the truth about her. But what is the truth? Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1928. Famed Chinese magician Wei Ling Soo, arguably the most admired man in his profession, is on a successful European tour. What the public does not know is that underneath his make-up and Chinoiserie, he is really Caucasian Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) of England. Stanley is a man of science, he believing that everything, like his illusions, can be explained logically. As such, he is an avowed atheist. Because of his non-belief of concepts such as faith, he is also a largely emotionless man. Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney), Stanley's childhood friend and a magician in his own right, asks him for a favor: help him expose a young American woman named Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) acting as a psychic and medium. Sophie and her mother (Marcia Gay Harden), who are from a poor background, have infiltrated the wealthy Catledge family of the French Riviera. The Bakers have been able to bilk money from the Catledges in their belief in what Sophie has told them. While the Catledge daughter Caroline (Erica Leerhsen) and her husband George (Jeremy Shamos) believe Sophie is a fake, the Catledge son Brice (Hamish Linklater) and the family matriarch Grace (Jackie Weaver) want to bring Sophie into their lives permanently, Grace, who wants to set up a foundation for Sophie, and Brice who wants to marry her. In observing Sophie's abilities, Howard, a skeptic, admits that he was unable to explain how Sophie was able to do the things that happened, such as making certain items levitate, and that she knew things that there is no way she could have known. Stanley is glad to oblige Howard's request, he often exposes mediums in his steadfast belief that there is no such thing as psychic ability. Stanley hopes to visit with his Aunt Vanessa (Dame Eileen Atkins), the woman who largely raised him, while he is doing this work for Howard. She lives in Provence and is arguably his favorite person in the world. In Stanley and Sophie meeting at the Catledge home, Sophie knows, based on his outward disdain toward her, that he is there to question her abilities. Stanley, conversely, admits to himself that time after time he cannot explain how Sophie does or knows what she does or knows. Regardless, he largely holds steadfast to his belief about her. But as Stanley spends more time with Aunt Vanessa and Sophie, he may come to a realization that a little unexplained phenomenon may actually make him a happier man. Huggo Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. Berlin, Germany. 1928 Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) is a British illusionist/magical debunker performing a show under the guise of Wei Ling Soo, a Chinese magician. He does such tricks as making an elephant disappear, sawing a woman in half, and entering a sarcophagus and re-emerging in a chair, to the delight of audiences. Backstage, Stanley is rude and snobbish towards his assistants and a fan seeking an autograph. He is approached by his old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney). Over a drink, Howard asks Stanley to travel with him to the French Riviera to see a wealthy family that have been enchanted by a young woman claiming to be a medium. Stanley's task is to reveal her as a fraud. He informs his fiance Olivia (Catherine McCormack) of his trip, as she is also a skeptic. The two friends drive to Cte d'Azur to meet the Catledge family. Stanley first meets Caroline Catledge (Erica Leershen) and her husband George (Jeremy Shamos), who both show concern over Caroline's brother Brice (Hamish Linklater), who is smitten with this so-called medium. He is heard practicing serenading her. Stanley and Howard meet Brice, who expresses his awe of this woman, as she has apparently seen things about himself that she couldn't have known, giving him a more introspective look on himself. This woman, Sophie Baker (Emma Stone), arrives with her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). Upon meeting Stanley, she gets a "mental vibration" of him being from the Orient, specifically China, and also deduces that he's done business in Germany. Not quite impressed, Stanley admits that he was recently in Berlin on business. Throughout the rest of the afternoon, Stanley displays his sarcasm and skepticism to Sophie and her mother. Mrs. Baker thinks he's obnoxious, and while Sophie agrees, she adds that he's not entirely unappealing. Brice strums his ukulele and sings to Sophie. He tells her he is very much in love with her and wants to marry her. She neither expresses interest nor disdain for him. That night, the Catledges gather for a seance in which Sophie attempts to communicate with the deceased husband of Brice and Caroline's mother, Grace (Jacki Weaver). Grace is eager to see if she can really speak to her husband. The family connects hands with each other and Sophie as she attempts to make contact. She beckons the spirit to knock once for "yes" and twice for "no". A knock is heard, and Stanley keeps his eyes peeled for anything. Suddenly, a candle begins floating in the air. Everyone, even Stanley, is baffled. Howard reaches to grab it, but sees no evidence of a wire or anything. Stanley still doesn't believe Sophie has any gift, but she is able to shake him a bit when he mentions his uncle and she gets another mental vibration of a "death by water". Stanley admits to Howard that his uncle drowned a few years back. Later, Sophie mentions seeing Wei Ling Soo as a child and enjoying the performance. She knows Stanley is the magician and tells him not to doubt what she can do. It's obvious Sophie has a hold on him as Stanley can barely sleep at night. The family holds another seance where Grace asks her deceased husband if she was always his only woman. One knock for yes. She then hesitantly asks if he ever had an affair with a specific woman she names. Two knocks for no. Grace is overjoyed. Sophie goes for a swim in the Catledges' pool. Brice continues to serenade her and then has the butler bring in a bunch of dresses that Sophie had been checking out in town. Stanley invites Sophie with him to go out on the town. She enjoys eating a lot, to Stanley's surprise. She even mentions information about Olivia and an older flame of Stanley's, Jenny. Stanley takes Sophie to the home of his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins), something of a mother to Stanley. Sophie asks Vanessa to hand her some type of jewelry, and she gives Sophie her pearl necklace. From holding it, Sophie determines a love affair of Vanessa's, as the necklace was given to her by a man that could not be with her because he was still married. This cracks Stanley, causing him to believe in Sophie's gifts and acknowledge her as the real deal. On their trip home, his car breaks down. He spends hours taking the engine apart and putting it back, but to no avail. A thunderstorm starts happening, scaring Sophie and making her think they'll die. She and Stanley run for shelter and find a nearby observatory. Stanley recognizes it from his youth. They go inside where he keeps Sophie close so she stays warm. He then takes her near the telescope and opens the roof, where they see the moon and stars up above. Everyone attends a fancy and lavish party. Stanley is dancing with Vanessa while Sophie cuts a rug with Brice. They switch partners, giving Stanley and Sophie a chance to walk together. She asks him if he has thought anything of her lately as a woman. He awkwardly responds that he hasn't seen her in that way, specifically as a woman, but he has become pleasantly surprised by what he's seen from her, regarding her gifts. Sophie leaves disappointed. Stanley, Sophie, and her mother gather with reporters for a press conference. Everyone asks Stanley about his new feelings regarding this type of magic or how he feels now as a skeptic. Moments later, George comes in to tell Stanley that his aunt has been in a car accident. He immediately steps out. At the hospital, Stanley is told that Vanessa is being treated by doctors. He sits down and starts to pray. For a moment, it appears that he really believes what he's saying, until he comes to a realization. He quickly dismisses all his beliefs and goes back to thinking Sophie is a fraud. Stanley returns to the Catledge home to confront Sophie. He asks her how she did not predict the car accident and warn him about it. He leaves the room with Sophie and Howard alone. It is then that we learn that the two of them conspired to trick Stanley. Howard knew Sophie was a fraud, but he wanted to really get Stanley after years of being second best to his more successful friend. Stanley then turns around in his chair to show that he has been listening the whole time. Sophie is ashamed and wants Stanley to forgive her, especially since she knows that his time spent with her has let him believe in new possibilities and have a new lease on life. Despite this, Stanley refuses to forgive her. Vanessa makes a full recovery, and Stanley picks her up and takes her home. When they get back, Stanley slowly begins to express his true feelings toward Sophie. He realizes he doesn't love Olivia as much as he thought, and he has fallen in love with Sophie. Stanley finds Sophie sitting on a swing. By now, she has already accepted Brice's marriage proposal. Stanley makes an uneasy proposal, saying she should marry him instead. Sophie says he already had his chance, and it's gone. She walks away while he tries to take the offer off the table. Stanley forgives Howard for trying to trick him. He also mentions that he broke it off with Olivia, who happened to be calm about it, as they both realized they weren't right for each other. Stanley returns to Vanessa's home one more time after being rejected. He sits in the living room talking aloud and expressing his regret over not expressing his love for Sophie earlier. He then hears a knock. He knows Sophie is near. He then asks if she'll marry him. Another knock for yes. Stanley turns around to see Sophie standing in the doorway. He goes up to her and they kiss.

In England in 1935, precocious 13-year-old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) lives on her family's country estate with her mother and sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley). Cecilia is home for the summer from Cambrige where she has been studying with the housekeeper's son, Robbie (James McAvoy). She and Robbie have an uncertain relationship; neither is willing to act on it but a certain romantic chemistry exists between them. One day, Briony sees from her bedroom window an argument between Cecilia and Robbie at the fountain. Robbie accidentally broke an antique vase and a piece of it fell into the fountain. Angrily, Cecilia stripped to her underwear and dived into the fountain to retrieve it. Briony is confused about the sexual tension between the two of them. The Tallises are being visited by young relatives from the north -- the twins Pierrot and Jackson (Felix and Charlie von Simson) and their 15-year-old sister, Lola (Juno Temple), whose parents are in the process of divorcing. Leon Tallis (Patrick Kennedy) brings his friend Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch) for dinner. Paul keenly follows Hitler's political advance and predicts war. He plans to sell chocolate bars to the British military to give to its soldiers. While he tries to amuse Pierrot and Jackson, Paul and Lola flirt. Embarrassed by his behavior earlier in the day, Robbie tries to write an apology note to Cecilia. One of the drafts includes a sexually charged declaration of his love for her. He then writes a more formal apology he intends to deliver to her. However, he accidentally gives the sexual note to Briony while walking to dinner at the Tallises that night; he gives her the note because he believes it will be less embarrassing if it comes from Briony instead of him. When he realizes what he has done, he calls out to Briony but she is too far away to hear him. Back in the house, she reads the note and is scandalized. She gives the note to Cecilia but later confides to Lola that she believes Robbie is a dangerous sex maniac. Lola has come to her with arm bruises that she accuses her twin brothers of giving to her but Briony ignores them. Robbie arrives for dinner. He and Cecilia discuss the note and admit their love for one another. They make passionate love in the library but are discovered by Briony. At dinner, it is discovered that Pierrot and Jackson have run away. Everyone looks for them. While looking for them by a creek, Briony stumbles on Lola being raped by someone. He runs away into the darkness. Briony insists to first Lola and then the police that Robbie was the culprit and brandishes the sexual letter to Cecilia as evidence. Only Cecilia protests his innocence. When Robbie returns with the twins, he is arrested for rape. Tried and convicted, he is sent to prison. Four years later he is released into the British army and makes up part of the British Expeditionary Force that is sent to northern France in an attempt to halt the Nazi advance. In northern France, Robbie and two fellow soldiers attempt to make their way to Dunkirk, where the remnants of the BEF are to be evacuated after the Nazis rout their forces and the French. He has a shrapnel wound in his chest. Several weeks earlier, before he left London, he saw Cecilia again. She remained true to him for four years and begs him to come back to her. She reveals that she has broken contact with her family over her love for Robbie and belief in his innocence. She gives him a photograph of a seaside cottage near Dover that they can retire to. It will give him strength as he struggles towards Dunkirk. Cecilia is a nurse in London. She learns that Briony, now 18 (Romola Garai) has decided not to study at Cambridge and is training to be a nurse herself. Briony knows that Robbie did not rape Lola, that it was Paul -- to whom Lola is now engaged and who has become a millionaire selling his candy to the British army. Briony goes to see Cecilia to admit her guilt and state her willingness to do whatever it takes to atone for her sins and clear Robbie's name. Robbie is in Cecilia's apartment when she gets there. Although they are angry with her, they tell her what she needs to do to make things right. She agrees, then leaves as Cecilia and Robbie are intimate for one last time before he is shipped to France with the BEF. In 1999, Briony (Vanessa Redgrave), now in her late seventies and dying of vascular dementia, is a famous novelist. Her new book, __Atonement__, will be published on her birthday. The foregoing narrative had been one she created for her book, as an act of atonement for what she did to Robbie and Cecilia. In real life, she never saw Cecilia after she left the family, and Cecilia and Robbie never had a last tender moment in her apartment before he left with the BEF. Instead, he died at Dunkirk of septicemia, waiting to be evacuated. Cecilia died a few months later when a German bomb burst a water main and flooded the subway tunnel in which she and other Londoners had taken refuge during the Blitz. Briony hopes that, by reuniting them, she gives them the happy conclusion to their lives that they deserved and her readers the hope that everyone needs to survive. Robbie and Cecilia walk down the beach on a bright, beautiful day. On the steps of the seaside cottage, they look at the beautiful white cliffs, then disappear inside. ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** THE FOLLOWING IS NOT COMPOSED BY ME. THIS APPEARS IN ONE OF THE MOVIE SPOILER WEBSITES AND IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE CALLED 'D Schwarz'. ITS SO DESCRIPTIVE AND FANTASTIC THAT I DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER IMDB USERS. THE TEXT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED IN ANY WAY AND APPEARS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN BY THE ORIGINAL WRITER. ************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ The film starts out with a 13 year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) writing a play that she wants to put on that evening for the return of her older brother Leon. She runs through the house and into the garden and finds twenty-something year old Robbie Turner the housekeeper's son (James McAvoy) as he is tending to the flowers. They exchange conversation and it's clear that she has a crush on him but he regards her as a little sister. We then see Briony's mother reading the play and loving it. The next scene shows Briony lying on the garden with her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). Briony asks Cecilia why she doesn't talk to Robbie anymore, Cecilia says she does, they just move in different circles. Then we see Briony rehearsing the play with her cousins, Pierrot and Jackson Quincy and their older sister Lola (Juno Temple). Lola is about 16 or so. The younger boys quickly get bored with the play and go off for a swim and Briony is left alone in the house. She is looking out the window and sees Cecilia and Robbie out by the fountain in some sort of argument. Then we see Cecilia strip down to her slip and jump into the fountain to retrieve something and she comes out and her slip is wet and sheer and Robbie looks away as she dresses and leaves. We suddenly see the same scene from the point of view of Cecilia and Robbie, as they are talking while walking into the garden, Cecilia is holding an expensive vase and as she tried to fill it with water from the fountain, Robbie tried to take it from her to fill it and she refuses and they pull on it, breaking the porcelain. It falls into the fountain, which is what Cecilia goes to retrieve. We then see Cecilia in her room, smoking, just generally getting ready for the evening. Through her window she sees her brother Leon drive up with a friend, some rich tycoon who owns a chocolate factory. She sees Leon talking to Robbie with dismay. They meet Leon's friend, who seems rather shady. Leon, Cecilia and the friend, Paul Marshall, are all swimming I the lake and it is revealed that Robbie and Cecilia went to school together and that Robbie is pursuing a medical degree. Leon informs Cecilia that he has invited Robbie to dinner, and Cecilia is upset at this. The scene then cuts to Robbie in his cottage typing a letter to Cecilia, trying to apologize for his behavior earlier that day. He types several drafts before finally typing a rather raunchy sexual letter to her. While he is typing we see the scene cut back and forth between him and Cecilia getting ready and putting clips in her hair. (Important) He laughs as he writes it, then folds it up and places it next to his typewriter. He then handwrites a very heartfelt apology and goes to get ready for dinner that evening. As he walks down the lane to the main house he sees Briony playing in the garden and asks her to deliver the letter to Cecilia, which she does. As she is running to the house, we see Robbie suddenly remember that he put the wrong letter in the envelope and in fact, the raunchy letter is being delivered. He screams for Briony but its too late and she is already in the house and is reading the letter. She then delivers it to Cecilia, but without the envelope, so Cecilia knows that she has read it. We then see Paul Marshall wandering through the house and comes across the cousins, Pierrot, Jackson and Lola. He entertains the children but it is also clear that he is interested in Lola. Later on Briony goes to her room to change for dinner and Lola enters her room, complaining about being tortured by her little brothers. Briony takes this opportunity to tell Lola what was written in the raunchy letter, calling Robbie a sexual maniac. She then gets ready for dinner and is running down the stairs when she sees a small hairclip on the floor. She picks it up and sees a light shining through a doorway, she follows it to see Robbie and Cecilia in an awkward position against the wall of the library, obviously having made love just moments before. We see Briony's teary face just as the scene cuts to Robbie ringing the doorbell for dinner. Cecilia answers the door and he tries to apologize for giving the wrong version of the letter. Cecilia takes him to the library and basically they admit their attraction to one another and start kissing and having sex up against the wall. In the middle of it they tell each other they love one another and then continue, until Cecilia hears the door open and Briony walk in. They disentangle themselves and leave the room, with Briony just watching them. At dinner they all pretend nothing's happened, until Mrs. Tallis notices that the young twin boys aren't at dinner so Briony is sent to get them. She comes back down and informs the group that the boys have run away, so a search party is immediately formed. Briony takes a flashlight and set out alone and stumbles across a man with his pants down on top of Lola. As soon as the flashlight shines on them he runs away, but you don't see his face. Lola is crying and Briony runs up to her, asking her who the man was. Lola isn't sure as her eyes were covered, but Briony convinces her it was Robbie. Lola is brought into the house and the police are called and Briony testifies that it was Robbie who attacked Lola and she is sure she saw him. Cecilia tells the police not to believe Briony as she is a fanciful girl but as soon as Robbie comes back to the house, having found the two young boys, the police take him away. The movie cuts to 4 years later and we see Robbie in France with two other privates in the army, as it is now WW2. They ask him what an educated man like him is doing as a private, to which Robbie responds, you can't get promoted if you've come out of prison and he was given a choice, stay in prison, or join the army. Then we see a scene from six months earlier where Robbie and Cecilia meet after 3 and 1/2 years and after some awkward conversation they declare their love for one another after all this time. Cecilia has become a nurse now in London and is living in an apartment and doesn't speak to her sister Briony or her family anymore. Robbie returns to the war but they continue to write letters, Cecilia tells him of a cottage by the sea they can visit the next time he is on leave and gives him a picture of it to hold on to. We see him throughout the film, going through battle and looking at the same picture every chance he gets. Cecilia also tells him that Briony is now in Nurse's training and has written to her, asking to talk. We then see a 18 year old Briony, in her nurse's uniform, trying to fit in at the hospital. She writes to Cecilia, asking to talk and telling her she only now realizes the full extent of her false testimony years ago. We see Robbie wounded in France and waiting for the roundup of soldiers to be taken to the hospital and then see Briony and the other nurses tending to injured soldiers. She imagines that she sees Robbie but he isn't there. Several days later Briony then leaves the hospital to attend the wedding of Paul Marshall, who is marrying her cousin Lola. Lola sees Briony at the wedding but ignores her. Briony then goes to Cecilia's apartment and begs to talk to her, to apologize. She sees Robbie there, who wants to break her neck but instead Robbie and Cecilia make Briony fix what she has done wrong and change her statement. Briony admits that she saw Paul Marshall attacking Lola that night in the garden and they become upset because Paul has just married Lola so he has immunity. We see Briony agree to change her statement and she leaves and we see Cecilia and Robbie finally together in the apartment, kissing. Then Briony is on a train and suddenly the screen goes black and a woman says, can we stop for a moment. We cut to present day and we see an old Briony Tallis (Vanessa Redgrave) being interviewed about her latest book, titled Atonement. She explains how it is her last book because she is dying and she wanted to be completely honest about all the events of the situation. She admits however that she wasn't honest about one part. That she never went to her sister that day to ask for forgiveness and that Robbie was never there because he died of septicemia in France waiting to be taken to the hospital a few months earlier. She also says that she never got to set things right with her sister because she was killed in a bomb blast a few months after Robbie died. Briony admits that she has had to live with this truth all her life so she changed it in her book, in order to give Cecilia and Robbie their chance to be together in her book, if not in real life. The last scene shows Cecilia and Robbie playing on the beach and then going into the cottage that Cecilia had talked about earlier and the movie ends.
