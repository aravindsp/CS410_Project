 Curro Jimnez (19761979)Summaries Set in the South of Spain in the 19th Century, this successful TV series featured the endless adventures of Curro Jimnez (prototype of the Andalusian "bandolero"), a kind of Spanish Robin Hood, and his gang, the two main members of which were El Estudiante and El Algarrobo.
