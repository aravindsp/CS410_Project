 Aces High (1976)Summaries In World War I, the high casualty rate amongst the rookie pilots of the Royal Flying Corps puts an enormous strain on the survivors. A naive young officer straight from school arrives on the Western front to fight the air war against the Germans. However, the life expectancy of green pilots is not very good. Orde Saunders <ODS101@York.ac.uk> October 1917. A few years behind him at Eton, Stephen Croft has always idolized John Gresham, who was once his house captain and who is dating his sister. When eligible, Croft enlisted with the Royal Flying Corps after Gresham did an enlistment drive at Eton a year earlier, and now a Second Lieutenant with only four hours of flying experience, pulled some strings for the open position with the 76 Squadron at a temporary field base in France under Gresham, a Major, as commanding officer and squadron leader. When he hears, "two weeks, that's how long you're lasting now," upon his arrival, Croft may not fully comprehend that that is the life expectancy of rookie pilots within the squadron. What Croft lacks in experience and skill, he makes up for in enthusiasm. During his time with the squadron, he will get a different perspective of both the war and Gresham, who not only did not want Croft there, but understands his own failings, he having turned to drink to cope with the horrors of war. While Captain Sinclair, fondly referred to as Uncle as the senior officer, tries to place a certain calm into the group, Gresham is tasked not only with leading the military battles, but holding the squadron together as a cohesive unit, when he too fully understands the feelings of someone like Lieutenant Crawford, who has a debilitating case of fear which he often hides behind mock ailments and a mock sense of arrogance.
