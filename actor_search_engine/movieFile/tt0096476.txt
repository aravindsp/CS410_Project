 Yasemin (1988)Summaries 20 years old Casanova Jan falls in love with the 3 years younger Turkish girl Yasemin, who lives in Germany with her family. She's well protected by her father, who believes in the Turkish traditions. She has to struggle for every little freedom that's certain for her German friends, but still respects and loves her father and keeps the appearance of an honorable Turkish girl. Her love to Jan however disturbs this fine balance. So it's not hate or quarrel that interferes with their love, but the differences of their cultures.
