 Between 10 and 12 (2014)Summaries After the police deliver him a piece of devastating news, a teenage boy and his girlfriend are taken on a trip through Rotterdam to find and inform his parents. Between the hours of ten and twelve a piece of news stops a family in its tracks, while around them life goes on as before. Just another summer's day. But on this particular day a piece of news, delivered by two officers in a police car, changes the life of a family forever. As the journey processes, the vehicle becomes more and more crowded with family members, picked up from home, work, the hairdressers. As they sit in the backseat, alone with their thoughts, what they thought they knew about life, about relationships, has been violently altered. And while the focus for their despair is all too clear, around them everyday things begin to lose meaning as the world becomes increasingly absurd.
