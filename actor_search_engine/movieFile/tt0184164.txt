 Tilly Trotter (1999)Summaries Tilly Trotter is a down to earth young woman who is full of integrity and impassioned with innocent affection for the local farmer. Resilience and self belief carry her through some very dark days, and this splendid adaptation shows us her journey from destitution to eventual happiness. True love grows with time and in the most unexpected of places. Tilly had her own mind, nobody can take that away from her. I totally recommend this film - the DVD is 3 hours long - every minute worth watching. A must for Catherine Cookson fans, and for realists and romantics.
