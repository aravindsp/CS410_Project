 Riana Rouge (1997 Video Game)Summaries After nearly being killed by her evil boss, a meek secretary learns that in another world she is actually a prophesied warrior, who must save the strange inhabitants of the land and kill its tyrant, who's also kidnapped her girlfriend. One night, shy secretary Riana (played by Playboy Playmate Gillian Bonner) tries to save her pretty colleague Javelin from being sexually assaulted by their evil boss Frank Virago, but he manages to push Riana out of the office window. However, instead of falling to her death, she finds herself in another world where a warrior woman who looks just like Javelin welcomes her and tells her that her name here is Riana Rouge and that she is the prophesied savior of this strange land and the heroine who must save this world from an evil tyrant. Unfortunately, the evil tyrannical stranger, who looks just like Frank, kidnaps Javelin in front of Riana's eyes. Now, scantily clad warrior Riana must travel through three strange worlds (a prison world where she must free an important prisoner, a world that resembles the mythical Arcadia where she must reach the garden of delight, and an alien world where a misogynous A.I. has imprisoned all the females of a peaceful tribal alien race), help the people there and find the way to enter the evil tyrant's castle, where her true love Javelin awaits to be rescued.
