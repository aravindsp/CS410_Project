The Appointment centers around Peter Bundle, a mid-thirties everyman who has never been known for making wise choices in life. While selling home alarm systems, he gets blackmailed by some "well-connected" people into supplying them with access codes to some very wealthy houses. They pay him handsomely for his services, but burdened by a new girlfriend with an expensive lifestyle and past mistakes that continue to catch up with him, Bundle foolishly steals millions from the very people who were blackmailing him and is finally forced to face the consequences of his actions.
