 Flowers in the Attic (1987)Summaries Children are hidden away under an attic by their conspiring mother and grandmother. Dreams of an inheritance turn into a nightmare for four innocent children. Locked in the deserted north wing of the family mansion. Beaten by a vicious grandmother. Tormented by a menacing caretaker. Starved and left alone to wither - and perhaps die - like FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. Their only hope lies in escape. But a horrible truth awaits them in the main house - a truth that will push the children toward a dizzying and violent solution. FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC - living proof that even the prettiest flowers can grow deadly in the attic's darkness. Anonymous After the death of her husband, a mother takes her kids off to live with their grandparents in a huge, decrepit old mansion.
