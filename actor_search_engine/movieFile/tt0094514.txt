 Murphy Brown (19882018)Summaries The personal and professional misadventures of an opinionated but beloved woman working as a television journalist. Murphy Brown (Candice Bergen) is a very selfish, stubborn, extremely hot-tempered, but also talented, resourceful, clever, and caring middle-aged reporter who works for FYI News Network and at the same time tries to raise her child as an unmarried, working woman. Her friends and co-workers, Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford), Frank Fontana (Joe Regalbuto), Jim Dial (Charles Kimbrough), and Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud), try to balance between her outbursts of anger and her family, personality, or even financial crises. It's a difficult life for Murphy, but she has the guts to live it. Xenophon Tsakanikas <ftpadmin@antigoni.med.auth.gr> Murphy Brown (Candice Bergen) is one of television's most honored journalists. Brilliant and persistent, Murphy is unafraid to ask tough questions of the mighty. She is also an unabashed liberal who is considered an enemy of George Bush's White House. Murphy works for "FYI", a Washington, D.C.-based network television newsmagazine series. A recovering alcoholic, Murphy returns from a stint at the Betty Ford rehabilitation center, free of booze and cigarettes, and correspondingly cranky. Her television show has a new producer, a whiz-kid half her age. She's also working with an airheaded ex-Miss America, a befuddled anchorman, and her best friend, a danger-loving gonzo reporter. Can Murphy Brown make a comeback to be the best in the business? How can she not? AB Gilpin It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
