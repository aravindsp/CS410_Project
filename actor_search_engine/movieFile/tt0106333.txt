Ajay Sharma (Shah Rukh Khan) is a young boy who seeks revenge for his father's death which was a result of the actions of his trusted employee Madan Chopra (Dalip Tahil) Chopra has two daughters, the elder one is Seema (Shilpa Shetty) and the younger one is Priya (Kajol). Ajay finds a way to cozy up to Seema in a plan to take revenge upon her father by seducing her. Meanwhile, the younger daughter Priya travels with her father Madan Chopra to Madras (now Chennai), for Madan's final kart race before he retires permanently. Madan has never lost before, but comes across Vicky Malhotra (Ajay Sharma in a disguise of brown contact lenses). Vicky allows Madan to win by slowing at the last corner and tells him that he couldn't beat his "guru".
