 Living in Your Car (2010 )Summaries "Living in Your Car" follows the winding karmic adventures of fallen corporate exec, Steve Unger, who was caught cooking the books and now finds himself legally forbidden from working in any position that involves "other people's money".

Shunned by family and friends, under court order to teach an ethics class to other "fallen angels", Steve now makes his home inside his luxury car.
