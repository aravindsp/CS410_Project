 Some Boxer (1916)Summaries Bill Sykes, an ex-heavy weight champion, tries to teach Wilkens to box, but the latter makes little headway and Bill doesn't think much of him. Wilkens, however, wants to make a bluff as a boxer and an athlete, so he sneaks around to pawn shops and buys all the trophy cups and belts he can find and decorates his rooms with them. His wealthy fiance, Amy Mortimer, accompanied by her mother as chaperon, and Tom and Harry call on Wilkens, and are astounded by his display of cups. He makes a bluff that he is some boxer; therefore all insist on seeing him take a lesson from Sykes. As Sykes is sore at him for being such a "dub," It looks like his finish, but he bribes Sykes and the latter lets Wilkens knock him out. Wilkens calls on Amy at an entertainment given by her mother, and finds her in company with Mr. Hammer, a burly young man who happens to be the college champion boxer. Hammer develops into quite a rival and Wilkens seems likely to lose his girl. Tom and Harry get up a carnival of amateur sports for charity. Hammer volunteers and signs. Not to be outdone, Wilkens volunteers and signs. He then arranges with Sykes to box four rounds with him. Wilkens is supposed to win. However, when he goes to the hall the night of the carnival, he learns he can't box with Sykes. He is to go with Hammer. As he knows he is a bluff and Hammer will half kill him, he nearly swoons. When they get in the ring Hammer tells Wilkens the four rounds goes for the girl, too, and Wilkens can't help himself. They box and Hammer makes a monkey of Wilkens until he stops to wave his hand at Amy. This makes Wilkens mad, and as Hammer's head is turned away, Wilkens knocks him out and wins the girl.
