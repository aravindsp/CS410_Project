 Piranhaconda (2012 TV Movie)Summaries Piranha/anaconda hybrid creatures hunt down the scientist who stole their egg, as well as a film crew making a slasher film in the jungle. Intent on finding the eggs of the gigantic half-piranha, half-anaconda hybrid that slithers around the lush Hawaiian jungles, the expert herpetologist, Dr Robert Lovegrove, and a team of scientists enter the beast's habitat. There, a film crew is shooting their latest slasher movie, utterly unaware that ruthless Pike and his gun-totting mercenaries are watching their every move. However, the criminals are the least of their worries, as the scaly, bone-crushing predator with the hundreds of razor-sharp teeth is lurking in the shadows, and humans are its prey. The massive monstrosity is part-fish and part-snake, combining the best of two worlds. Is there an escape from the jaws of the Piranhaconda?
