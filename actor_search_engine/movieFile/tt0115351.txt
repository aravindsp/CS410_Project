 The Sentinel (19961999)Summaries In the jungles of Peru, the fight for survival heightened his senses. Now, Detective Jim Ellison is a sentinel in the fight for justice. Anthropologist Blair Sandburg works side by side with Jim, helping him develop these senses. After his helicopter was shot down and his Army Special Forces team lost, sole survivor James Ellison spent eighteen months in the Peruvian jungle living with the Chopec. Five years later, Ellison is now a police detective assigned to the Major Crime unit in Cascade, Washington. Ellison developed hyperactive senses during his time in the jungle, which went away after his return to the US. While on stakeout in a remote forest area his heightened senses abruptly return. He can see people in darkened windows at night from two hundred yards, hear the music playing on the radio of the car he's chasing after he's lost sight of it, and can distinguish between wood and plastic after both have been in a three thousand degree fire. Blair Sandburg, a PhD candidate in Anthropology at Rainier University, tells Ellison that he is a "Sentinel," who in ancient tribes would protect the village and seek out game using such hyperactive senses. Sandburg becomes Ellison's back-watcher/Guide and teaches him how to use his powers as Ellison brings a whole new edge to the war on crime in Cascade, Washington.
