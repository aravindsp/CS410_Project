 All the Loving Couples (1969)Summaries In a suburban home during one Friday night four couples get together to drink, smirk, paw, watch dirty movies and denounce racial prejudice. In a suburban home during one Friday night four couples get together to drink, smirk, paw, watch dirty movies and denounce racial prejudice. The group has a blond, two brunettes and a redhead, among the women. Divided up another way, we have one beginner, one lesbian, one sado-masochist and one routine run-of-the-mill swinger. The men include a liberal Jew, a racist Bircher WASP, an insurance salesman who's there (he says) to make contacts, and one guy who's impotent. The movie consists of all these people doing their thing, especially the Bircher and the Jew, who trade political taunts along with their wives. One guy can't be satisfied, no matter how often his wife gives it up. Next door, the husband is so dis-interested that his wife has to take care of her own needs with a vibrator. Finally all four couples get together and the chemistry turns out to be just right. It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
