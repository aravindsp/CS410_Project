 Hope & Faith (20032006)Summaries They're sisters, but blood may be the only thing they have in common. When Faith, a soap opera diva, is killed off her show, "The Sacred and the Sinful," she flees the tabloids by moving to the suburbs with her sister, Hope's, family. Hope, a down-to-earth, happily married mom of three in Glen Falls, Ohio, had her tidy world up-ended by the arrival of her celebrity sister, Faith. Faith was living the high life in Hollywood as a daytime soap opera star until her soap's character, Ashley Storm, was suddenly and unceremoniously killed off on "The Sacred and the Sinful" by her evil twin. After a year under her roof wreaking occasional havoc, Hope can attest that you can kill the diva off on the daytime drama, but you can't take the drama out of the diva.
