 Give & Take (I) (2013)Summaries Ellie is an idealistic, young actress living in NYC. She's a very giving person, so when her husband, Mitchell, gets a job offer back home in Buffalo, Ellie reluctantly agrees to the move. Mitchell loves Buffalo, so Ellie looks for happiness there, too. She joins a little theatre company and, unwittingly, winds up emotionally involved with the director, James. Ellie just keeps on giving and others keep on taking! James casts Ellie in a theme park show and tells her it will be lots of fun, and she'll get to do it eight times a day! He neglects to mention the grueling physical challenges involved. The show finally puts Ellie over the edge and, at last, she learns to take care of herself. She returns to Mitchell, but on her own terms this time. Anonymous It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
