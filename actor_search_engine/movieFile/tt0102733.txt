 Pyrates (1991)Summaries Ari (Kevin Bacon) and Sam (Kyra Sedgwick), have incendiary sex a lot and burn down apartment blocks, wig-wams, etc... As soon as they meet Ari and Sam get into a pretty passionate - and combustible - relationship. Indeed, the scenes of their rendezvous often seem reminiscent of the Chicago Fire. But the course of true flaming lust never runs true, and as they try to handle their all-consuming passion their two best friends endlessly meet to compare notes on developments.
