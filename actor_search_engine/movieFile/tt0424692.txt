 Normalerweize (20042011)Summaries Satirical show conceived and performed by Lrke Winther and Anna Neye Poulsen . This satirical sketch show is Anna Neye Poulsen and Lrke Winther 's take on contemporary political topics as well as societal issues. Accompanied by Martin Buch 's iconic "Snobben Fritz"-character, Anna and Lrke focus their spoofs on people who are full of themselves, but often lack a justification for their smugness. Throughout the series, several recurring sketches and actual mini-series appear; some of which are heavily influenced by Anna and Lrke's love-hate relationship with American soap operas (especially The Bold and the Beautiful (1987) ).
