As she settles into a new life, she begins to suspect that her marriage has a sinister darkness, one that rivals her new home's history. Based on the acclaimed novel by Elizabeth Brundange.. Catherine Clare reluctantly trades life in 1980s Manhattan for a remote home in the tiny hamlet of Chosen, New York, after her husband George lands a job teaching art history at a small Hudson Valley college. Even as she does her best to transform the old dairy farm into a place where young daughter Franny will be happy, Catherine increasingly finds herself isolated and alone. She soon comes to sense a sinister darkness lurking both in the walls of the ramshackle property and in her marriage to George. Coming Soon With the promise of turning the page, George Claire, a handsome, self-centred academic, talks his wife, Catherine, an experienced art restorer, into putting her successful career on hold so that he can teach art history at Saginaw College. However, after moving from 1980s Manhattan to the verdant town of Chosen, New York, a shaky fresh start awaits Catherine and their five-year-old daughter, Franny, as the already challenging task of restoring their gloomy 18th-century new home is paired with the discovery of foreboding remnants left behind by the previous owners. Now, little by little, a corrosive undercurrent of malaise gets in the way of happiness, and Catherine finds herself trapped in her own home. But, she knows that, sometimes, her mind can play cruel tricks on her. Is death only the beginning? Nick Riganas It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
