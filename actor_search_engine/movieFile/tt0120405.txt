 A Brother... (1997)Summaries Loic is a photographer who is trying to leave his working-class background behind and make a name for himself as an artist. His best friend Tony has become involved with both hard drugs and Loic's former girlfriend Virginie, while man-about-town Vincent, who has plenty of connections in the art community, has developed a keen interest in Loic's sister Sophie who is still at school but growing up fast and does not know what she wants in life. However, Loic and Sophie are very close -- perhaps closer than a brother and sister should be -- and Loic is not comfortable with Vincent's obviously sexual interest in her.
