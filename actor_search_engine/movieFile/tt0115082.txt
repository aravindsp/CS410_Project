 3rd Rock from the Sun (19962001)Summaries A group of aliens are sent to Earth, disguised as a human family, to experience and report life on the third planet from the sun. A group of aliens has come to Earth to learn about its population, customs, et cetera. To avoid detection, they have taken on human form, which gives them human emotions, physical needs, et cetera, without the understanding of what they mean nor the inhibitions normally present in humans. Their leader takes the position of a college professor, their military expert as his sister, their intelligence expert, supposedly the oldest of group, takes the form of his teenage son. The uninhibited reactions turn everyday events into unusual situations. Jim Brawn <jim_brawn@amuc.mtroyal.ab.ca> The high commander of an alien expedition lands on Earth, what he considers to be the least-important planet, in human form as Dr. Dick Solomon (John Lithgow). Along for the ride are his alien compatriots Harry (French Stewart), Sally (Kristen Johnston), and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - who is the eldest of the group, but is now angrily trapped in a teen's body.
