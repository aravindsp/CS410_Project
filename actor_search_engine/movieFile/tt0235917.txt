 Dora the Explorer (20002019)Summaries Along with her friend Monkey Boots, Dora goes on adventures. Dora is a little Hispanic girl with who goes on adventures with her red boot wearing monkey, conveniently named Boots. During her adventures we also get to meet her talking backpack (or la mochila) and the map who sings an annoyingly cute song. The show plays out almost like a computer adventure showing a mouse on different scenes where the kids make a decision. Dora asks your kids questions and then waits for a response. Dora would then congratulate your child for trying, while replying back with the correct answer to encourage them. The main purpose of the show is to teach Spanish to English-speaking children.
