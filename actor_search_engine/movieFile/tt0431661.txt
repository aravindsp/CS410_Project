 Bowling Balls (2004 Video)Summaries A horror-comedy in which J and Shaggy are in-keepers of a bed and breakfast who murder their guests and keep their severed heads. Bowling Balls follows the story of two girls who break down out in the middle of "what you would call nothingness" during a road trip to Daytona. But almost as if it were too good to be true, a "localer" and "propateer" of a bed and breakfast in town, Mr. Violent J, comes to the rescue. Rather than sit in an old broken down truck in the middle of nowhere while they wait for their friends to come pick them up, they decide to go with J. About 10 seconds in the door is when the bloody mayhem ensues as Shaggy, J's retarded hunchback brother, comes in out of left field and lops one of the girl's head off. Meanwhile, their friends--a snooty Asian girl, a pothead jock and a preppy black guy--are on their way to the bed and breakfast to pick them up. Totally unaware of what is about to happen to them. Soon hatchets will be lodged into foreheads, heads will be accidentally chopped off with scythes and a particularly hilarious scene follows where Shaggy ruthlessly severs a head for a good 2 or 3 minutes. All the while going back and forth from comedic horror show to upbeat and bloody music video. Riki It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
