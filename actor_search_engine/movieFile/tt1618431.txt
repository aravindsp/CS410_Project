 Here Is Something Beautiful (Etc.Summaries Here Is Something Beautiful (etc. is a look at the life of one of America's most unique and influential writers, Richard Brautigan. Brautigan rose to international fame in 1967 with the publication of his novel, Trout Fishing in America, which linked him, for better or worse, to the Beats and the emerging counterculture. Largely dismissed or ignored by American critics, his work has since been translated into over twenty languages and continues to demand reprinting around the world. At the time of his suicide in 1984, he had produced eleven novels, ten collections of poetry, a collection of short stories and several works of non-fiction. Defined largely by its accessability, immediacy and magic, Richard's writing offered, in many ways, what he could not. Here Is Something Beautiful (etc. brings together family, friends and readers from over a dozen countries to bridge the writer with his work and to remember the extraordinary life that made it possible.
