 Night Stand (19951999)Summaries Of all the talk shows, there's only one show that doesn't hesitate to take up such serious issues as teenage prostitution, aliens from outer space or breast implants in the Dick Dietrick style. Mattias Thuresson Mocking Jerry Springer-like talk shows, Night Stand was a fake talk show hosted by lovable, Dick Dietrick, played masterfully by Timothy Stack. Dick would bring on ridiculous guests and go into a plethora of even more ridiculous questions. A Springer/Ricky Lake- type show, the "Dick Dietrick Show" would bring on guests that not even fans of the entire "outrageous" talk show genre would want to see. Many of the themes had sexual overtones, obvious to everyone watching, except for Dick himself who would make comments that everyone else found explicit, but Dick himself thought nothing of it. Soon after he would scold the audience when realizing the sexual overtone, and say, "People, no....no." Joshua Bozeman <JBoze3131@aol.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
