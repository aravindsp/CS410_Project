 Stowaway (2021)431) A three-person crew on a mission to Mars faces an impossible choice when an unplanned passenger jeopardizes the lives of everyone on board. The crew of a spaceship headed to Mars discovers an accidental stowaway shortly after takeoff. Too far from Earth to turn back and with resources quickly dwindling, the ship's medical researcher emerges as the only dissenting voice against the group consensus that has already decided in favor of a grim outcome. Theo Rich After taking off from Earth, the hand-picked, highly trained team of astronauts--Commander Marina Barnett, biologist David Kim, and medical researcher Zoe Levenson--embarks on a two-year scientific mission to distant Planet Mars. However, in their attempt to make the celestial body habitable and find a possible new home for humankind, the crew is not alone. Now, with the flight past the critical point of no return and the fuel and oxygen resources depleting, Marina makes a shocking discovery: the hidden, unconscious, and wounded fourth passenger, Michael Adams. Suddenly, having enough oxygen to breathe becomes the number one priority, and while faced with an agonising ethical dilemma, someone has to die. The question is, who? Nick Riganas Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. The first five minutes the crew is shaking uncontrollably, but trying to maintain their cool, during takeoff. The crew begin to get adjusted to the habitat, getting themselves settled. Before long, the commander/pilot Marina sees some blood on the floor, looks up, unscrews a panel, discovers a stowaway (Michael), bleeding badly, who is larger than the space accommodates, and he quickly falls down on top of her, breaking her arm. Some equipment behind his body in the compartment appears damaged. The crew wonders if he stowed away intentionally, but this plot point is never answered; he claims he does not remember and someone would have had to screw the panel down from the outside after he was 'in' in any case. Zoe, the doctor, sews him up, with help from David, the scientist. The stowaway is somewhat hysterical upon regaining consciousness, having left his disabled (we never learn exactly how) sister behind alone, on Earth; as a result of his reaction, the crew decides he did not stow away on purpose. There are a few brief scenes where Michael eats with the crew and works alongside David, though he is clearly not qualified to be aboard a space ship as an astronaut. Michael is the largest person on board, and Hyperion (the NASA alternative/private space company) is not able to figure out how he got on board, nor how to fix the oxygen scrubber that was permanently damaged by the stowaway's body, he used up extra fuel and oxygen in takeoff that was not planned for, and there are NO replacement parts. Marina asks David to work on increasing his algae project, using up all the resources that were intended for his research project on Mars, to try to produce enough oxygen for even three of them to survive without the scrubber. Concurrently, Marina tries to get Hyperion to come up with a solution (besides offing Michael) and they (with all the world's best minds) can't come up with anything that would allow them to survive the journey. Zoe wants to give Michael extra time while they try to find a solution anyway, David and Marina do not, but they compromise on 10 days, and are ordered to tell Michael nothing. Frustrated at the life threatening risk Michael's presence poses to all the lives of the approved astronauts, David comes up with a lethal injection and offers it to Michael, with an explanation. But Zoe finds Michael, trembling with the injector, and stops him from doing it. She accuses David of not caring, but David (who has a wife at home) has sacrificed ALL of the raw material for his scientific mission for two years in the hope of keeping them all alive, and half of his algae died. He asks what she has done. Zoe decides to go on a space walk, David ultimately comes with her bc Michael can't physically do it, for lack of training; it does look extremely difficult and something that would take a long time to learn to do well. They try to walk down long cables hooking the main spacecraft to the rocket which launched them off, in the hopes of filling some oxygen tanks (that look like what someone with emphysema would use - not larger) with remaining oxygen from the launch craft. Zoe succeeds in filling the first tank, and is working on the second tank, but SOLAR STORM! They have to rush back or die from radiation. They rush back and the first tank, which is in no way tethered to Zoe (they have knots on the rope, not even carabiners!) flies off into space just as Zoe and David make it back aboard. The oxygen tank on the launch craft is leaking and Marina says the solar storm will last five hours. Zoe volunteers to go back and fill the second tank, though even if she succeeds, it will supposedly only be enough oxygen for survival of 2/4 of them. She makes it down, fills it up, brings it back up, then apparently dies of solar radiation and floats off into space.
