 Let the Women Wait (1998)Summaries Two men travel to Thassos, where their families are on vacation. On the way, however, various unexpected and comic events happen to them. End of July, and it's holiday time. Panos and Michalis are brothers-in-law from Thessaloniki and run a small business together. Brimming over with high spirits, they leave for Thasos to meet their families. In the vicinity of Lake Volvi, their brief encounter with a young bar woman delays them. Panos, who is madly in love with her, attempts to commit suicide, and Michalis is forced to strike camp by the lake. Antonis, the third brother-in-law, who is concerned about their delay, comes around to find out what has happened, only to fall himself for one of the nurses treating Panos. He forgets about everything else and goes with her to the casino, where he wins on the roulette tables. Their relationship, naturally, does not reach fruition. Antonis reunites with Panos and Michalis, and they all start afresh for Thasos, but on the spur of the moment they decide to stop over at a hotel. Since their women can wait for them, they might just never go back. Anonymous Brothers-in-law, Michalis, and his polar opposite, Panos, embark on a long summer road trip from the bustling industrial zone of Thessaloniki to the island of Thasos to reunite with their families who are on vacation. On their way, however, an unforeseen complication in the shape of a young, statuesque singer, and a hopeless infatuation, will abruptly interrupt their journey, paving the way for heartbreak and soul-searching. Now, there is no turning back, and, sooner or later, the boys will have to answer not only to their exasperated wives but also to their well-to-do third brother-in-law, Antonis. But, is it polite to keep women waiting? Nick Riganas It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
