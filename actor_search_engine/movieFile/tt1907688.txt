 3 Holes and a Smoking Gun (2014)Summaries An ex-Hollywood screenwriter, now teaching an evening class in New York, finds himself in a battle of wits with a devious screenwriting student. 19-year-old Jack Ariamehr toils daily as a 'sign spinner' on the street corners of New York. But under the gaze of the State of Liberty, he dreams of bigger things -- and who wouldn't? No one is more aware of this than Jack's teacher, Bobby Blue Day -- an ex-Hollywood screenwriter who shows up at Jack's apartment early one morning eager to talk about Jack's screenplay. To Bobby's astonishment, J.F.K. Ariamehr has written the best screenplay he's ever read. And Bobby will do anything to get a piece of this last chance at the American dream.
