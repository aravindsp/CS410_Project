 The Last Stop (2000)Summaries A group of quirky, snowbound strangers discover there are killers amongst them. In this claustrophobic thriller, Jason (Adam Beach) is a State Trooper who has found himself stranded in a cabin in the Colorado Rockies when a severe snowstorm hits the area. Waiting out the storm with Jason are his former girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan), the owner of the cabin, Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow), and a handful of travelers they've never met before. While the blizzard rages outside, Fritz makes a shocking discovery. Hidden in the cabin is a bloody corpse and a bag full of money. Jason figures that the murder must have been committed since they arrived at the cabin, so whoever the culprit is, they're patiently waiting with him for the storm to die down. But he's not sure how to figure out who the killer might be -- especially since they may very well be willing to kill again to hold onto the cash. Starring: Adam Beach, Jrgen Prochnow, Rose McGowan, Callum Keith Rennie, Winston Rekert Producers: David Forrest, Beau Rogers dwmsb It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
