 Me Again (2012)Summaries Things don't go as expected when a disenchanted pastor wishes for a different life. Frustrated, deeply dissatisfied and burned out, Pastor Chaplin prays to have a different life. Much to his consternation (and in resemblance to his favorite TV show, Quantum Leap), his "request" is granted.
