 Eldorado (19921993)Summaries A soap opera about the ex-pats who lived in Los Barcos. The series focused mainly on the British and their lives, loves and attempts to make a new life for themselves. Pete A soap of two halves. Woefully bad at the start with some truly awful acting, I'm looking at you Fizz and Snowy, but the adage of so bad it's good definitely applied here. One major problem which was never satisfactorily resolved was having french, Spanish, and Dutch families speaking among themselves without subtitles. Later in the show everybody spoke English which stretched credulity. At almost exactly the half way mark Eldorado suddenly became something you could admit to watching. The storylines were stronger and grittier and it went out on a high. It's a shame as the viewing figures were healthy. podcastofevil It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
