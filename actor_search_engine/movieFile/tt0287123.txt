 The Wednesday Night Save the World Society (2001)Summaries Eight people come together to save the world and wind up saving each other. Feeling increasingly trapped, frustrated and alone, middle-aged Los Angeles resident Dee Barnes decides to turn her life (and hopefully the lives of others) around by starting a weekly discussion open to anyone who cares to join. She soon finds her house filled with an assortment of characters, including a bulimic goth, a sexist jerk, and a meek young man who only wants to protect the environment. As they open up to each other with their ideas and feelings, they gradually start to learn more about themselves.
