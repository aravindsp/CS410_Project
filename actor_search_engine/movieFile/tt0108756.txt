 Due South (19941999)44) The adventures of an impossibly upright Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable and his American colleagues in the city of Chicago. The third and fourth seasons of "Due South" pick up shortly after the first two left off. Fraser returns to Chicago, to find a blond has assumed Ray Vecchio's identity, and everyone just seems to accept it but him. Fraser and his new partner (real name Stanley Raymond Kowalski) soon find level ground to agree on, and work together to solve crimes on the mean streets of Chicago. Kaolin This is the story of a Canadian mountie who went to Chicago to find his father's killer. Eventually the trail led back to another mountie. He was then treated as persona non grata by his other mounties, and the only place he could get posted was Chicago. Unfortunately, he is more of an outdoors kind of guy, which infuriates the Chicago detective with whom he works. <rcs0411@yahoo.com> Due South is the story of Constable Benton Fraser of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (portrayed by Paul Gross), who came to Chicago on the trail of the people who murdered his father. For reasons that don't need to be explored at this juncture, he stayed, as liaison to the Canadian Consulate. Partnered with Ray Vecchio (played by David Marciano for the first two seasons), he went around Chicago being polite and solving crimes by tasting things. At the beginning of the third season, however, Fraser took a vacation in Canada, and came back to find that someone was impersonating his partner. In fact, Stanley Raymond Kowalski (played by Callum Keith Rennie) was taking Ray Vecchio's place while Ray was undercover, as was learned later that episode. The series ended in 1998.
