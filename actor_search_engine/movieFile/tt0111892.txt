 Baywatch Nights (19951997)Summaries Baywatch veteran Mitch Buchannon moonlights as a P.I. with his two friends Garner and Ryan. In season 2, Diamont replaces Garner, and Mitch's cases suddenly take a hard turn towards supernatural horror. In this Baywatch spin-off, Mitch Buchannon, the always reliable Los Angeles county lifeguard, moonlights as a private detective alongside his beach cop buddy Garner and a female N.Y. private dick named Ryan McBride. They investigate and solve crimes together, often in some way related to Mitch's beloved beach. Luckily, they're usually not alone in this fight, as their frequent associates include cute psychic, Destiny Desimone, Mitch's lifeguard colleague, Donna Marco, and Lou Raymond, a legendary musician who owns the nightclub called 'Nights' where the trio's detective agency is located. However, in season 2, the show gets a serious overhaul as Mitch's cases suddenly start to exclusively involve supernatural horror and his enemies become actual demons, ghosts, monsters and other supernatural phenomena. He faces these otherworldly foes together with Ryan, as their relationship becomes more platonic in nature (mimicking that of Mulder and Scully), and Diamont Teague, Garner's replacement for this season.
