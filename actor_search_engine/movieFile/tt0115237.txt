 L.A. Heat (19961999)Summaries The action-packed cases of 2 cops, one white one black, in LA. A wisecracking combination, with plenty of action, chases and explosions thrown in for good measure. Cynan Rees <cynanrees@hotmail.com> LA Heat partners Steven Williams as Detective August Brooks and Wolf Larson as Detective Chester "Chase" McDonald. The two L.A.P.D officers may be different as night and day but their styles compliment each other. Brooks, a seasoned detective, is far more experienced than McDonald and often acts as the voice of reason. McDonald, who has been with the police department for seven years, likes the thrill of adrenaline, courting danger and looking for action. LA Heat was a PM Entertainment production, aired in the US on TNT and in over 65 countries internationally. 'Rita J. Runyon' (qv) It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
