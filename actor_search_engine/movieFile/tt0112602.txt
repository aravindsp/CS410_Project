 Bushwhacked (1995)Summaries On the run from authorities, a sleazy courier poses as a Scout leader on a camping trip. But he has no idea what he's in for when he must actually take charge of a group of kids. As Max is on the job making a delivery, he finds out that the guy who hired him was using him to move money around--and that he is dead. Afraid that the police will think he is the killer, Max flees, and gets forced to pose as a Scout leader for a bunch of kids hiking through the mountains as the police pursue him.
