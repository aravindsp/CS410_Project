 Young Doctors in Love (1982)Summaries It's a spoof on hospital soap operas with a few gangsters thrown in. A new batch of interns begins at City Hospital. An 'Airplane'-style spoof of hospital soap operas: a brilliant young trainee can't stand the sight of blood; a doctor romances the head nurse in order to get the key to the drugs cabinet; there's a mafioso on the loose disguised as a woman - in other words all the usual ingredients present and correct, though in this case the laughs are intentional.
