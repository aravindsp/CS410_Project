 Big Brother (V) (20012021)Summaries A group of everyday, run of the mill Australians placed in a house (located at Dreamworld in sunny Queensland's Gold Coast) surrounded by cameras and microphones for 3 months to compete for a $250 000 cash prize Twelve contestants, who have never met are challenged to stay in a house, cut off from any contact with the outside world for 85 days. There is a cash prize of $250,000 for the winner. The contestants are free to leave at any time, but if they do, they walk away empty-handed. Once a week the contestants nominate three members of the group for eviction, with viewers making the final decision, by way of a phone-in, of who will leave the house. Conditions inside the house are basic, but occupants earn money to supplement their rations if they all successfully complete weekly assignments, designed to test their team spirit. Over the weeks the numbers will be whittled away until eventually, one contestant will emerge victorious. In the meantime, the residents of the BIG BROTHER house have no idea of what the public thinks of them or what impact they are having on the world. Anonymous The concept is simple. A cast of 14 young Australians live out a real-life drama in a purpose built house for three months. 25 cameras will follow their every move, 24 hours a day. House members will compete for a $250,000 cash prize. The person to survive to the end, by earning the greatest respect of their housemates and the viewing public, will walk away with the cash. It's a 'docu-soap', where the characters are fully exposed. All the human drama of a bunch of strangers thrown together, completely cut off from the outside world, sharing everything. All the while, Big Brother, and a massive audience, is watching. Anonymous It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
