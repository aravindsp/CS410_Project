 Parker Lewis Can't Lose (19901993)Summaries For a cool high school kid and his friends, thwarting authority figures and other enemies is not a problem. Trendy high school student Parker Lewis (a character similar to Ferris Bueller), for whom, as suggested by his motto, "Not a problem," nothing is impossible. Like his best buds Mikey Randall and Jerry Steiner, and his girlfriend Annie Sloane, his prime concern is achieving and maintaining coolness during the turbulent years of puberty. However, their efforts keep being thwarted by Parker's little sister, Shelly, and principal Grace Musso. Apart from various aspects of teenage life, embedded in a wealth of cartoon-like special effects and camera trickery, an episode regularly contains more or less subtle references to movies, politics, and celebrities.
