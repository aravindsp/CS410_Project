 The Sasquatch Hunters (1997)Summaries "The Sasquatch Hunters" is a mockumentary following a number of unusual characters as they search for, and obsess over, Bigfoot. We meet several groups: The Bigfoot Society, a cell of true believers; the American Hominid Association (AHA), a government funded band of trackers; and the Michigan Cryptozoological Institute, a cult-like organization devoted to welcoming the Sasquatch-American into western society. These and other characters cross paths and eventually converge at an impromptu festival, dubbed "Bigfoot Bonanza". Marc Messenger It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
