 Black Scorpion (2001)Summaries The City of Angels is falling apart, and crime pervades the city to the core. The mayor is corrupt, the police are inept, the city needs a figure to take control of the situation. Then in the light of day Darcy Walker is a cop, but in the dark of night she becomes the Black Scorpion. She does with a mask what she can't do with a badge. This is vigilante justice, old school style. Jeff (DrkAngel_113) It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
