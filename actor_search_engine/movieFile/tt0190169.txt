 3-2-1 Contact (19801992)Summaries A children's show explaining various principles of science and their applications. In this series, we follow the explorations of kids as they explore science in its various fields with experiments, films, cartoons and demonstrations. To highlight these principles application in an entertaining way, we also watch the cases of the Bloodhound Gang, a group of kids who are junior detectives for a private detective agency who use simple scientific knowledge, research and deduction to solve the crimes they encounter. Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> 3-2-1 Contact follows a company of young hosts who investigate the different domains of science, exposing kids to aspects of the subject that might otherwise be impossibly remote. Mini-documentaries, music videos, animation and visits to men and women at the forefront of the field introduce children to the world of science and technology in ways that are inviting, exciting and, most important, easy to understand.
