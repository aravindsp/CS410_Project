 Cattle Call (2006)Summaries A guy starts a fake casting agency in hopes that he will meet his soul mate. In Los Angeles, three guys with limited social lives hatch a plan to meet women: they'll issue a casting call for an independent film, interview actresses, and ask out the ones who interest them. Glenn is a nerd, but he has the office. Sherman has the idea--he's a hound, happy to lie, eager to meet and bed as many women as he can fool. Ritchie, who owns the camera, hopes to meet his true love. Within a few days, he's fallen for Marina Dell, new in town with a boyfriend back East; Glenn is gaga for Laurel, and Sherman can't say no to the adventurous Nikita. How long can they sustain the fiction, and what about real feelings? <jhailey@hotmail.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
