 The Persuaders! (19711972)Summaries Two worlds collide when the titled Englishman, Lord Brett Sinclair, and the Bronx-raised, self-made American Danny Wilde, reluctantly join forces to right wrongs, and to protect the innocent. English Lord Brett Sinclair and American Danny Wilde are both wealthy playboys, they are teamed together by Judge Fullton to investigate crimes which the police can't solve. These two men are complete opposites, but become great friends through their adventures and constantly risk their own lives for one another. Daniel Bolton <klsdb4@cynergy.com.au> Mix two relatively harmless compounds like nitro and glycerine, and you've got yourself a very potent combination, just like in the case of the titled Englishman, Lord Brett Sinclair, and the Bronx-raised, self-made American Danny Wilde. Joined into an improbable team by a not-so-unexpected bar brawl and the ingeniousness of the retired Judge Fulton, the two men of immense quality and potential are off to search for loopholes overlooked and to redress one of the anomalies of the law, that is in protecting the innocent, the guilty often go free too. Sometimes rivals, sometimes allies, nevertheless, always companions, Lord Brett, the noble, first-class athlete and artistic polyglot, and Danny, the irrepressible, optimistic and courageous oil tycoon, together they are bound to get the job done. Who could stand in the way of such an unlikely but powerful alliance? Nick Riganas It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
