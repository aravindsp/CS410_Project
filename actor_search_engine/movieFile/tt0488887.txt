Benji's birthday is coming up and Beth wants to buy him a telescope. She goes into a store only to discover that it is owned by an old friend from high school. The friend remembers that Beth was pregnant during senior year. Beth senses a subtle put-down and quickly picks out a telescope. But her debit card is refused, which is very embarrassing. She goes to the bank to straighten it out, only to be told that they are closing. The security guard finally has to order her to step away from the door. Beth pawns her gold necklace and buys the telescope. She goes to have dinner with Benji and his father, who has recently married. He is a teacher but will soon be promoted to principal. While Benji is on a tour of the kitchen, his father informs Beth that he wants custody. He points out that the child is getting too heavy for Beth to lift in and out of the wheelchair. Beth angrily says she will never give him custody, but he has already seen a lawyer. He can better provide for the child and he points out how Beth needs to get her life organized. On the way home, Beth becomes distracted and nearly hits another car. She slams on the brakes, causing Benji to smash his face against the dashboard. He is crying and bleeding so Beth goes to the emergency room. He requires stitches but will be fine. Unknown to Beth he calls his father, who arrives and chews Beth out for her carelessness. He insists on taking Benji home with him. Beth's car stalls at a red light. She tries to start it and the cars behind her begin honking when the light turns green. Diana is directly behind her, in a hurry to get to the airport. She yells at Beth, calling her "honey" and telling her to move the damn car. She finally pulls out of the line and drives away, but not before Beth recognizes the bumper sticker. Her car starts and she takes off after Diana. Catching up with her at the next red light, Beth picks up the telescope and exits the car. She begins hitting the car with the telescope, screaming that this is the car who cut her off that morning, making her late for work and causing her to lose her job. Diana is obviously frightened and passersby stop to stare. With one last blow, Beth breaks the telescope just as the light changes. Diana drives away and Beth follows. They drive recklessly and it begins to rain. Then both cars crash. At the hospital, Benji, his father and stepmother are in the waiting room with Diana's family. They don't speak to each other.
