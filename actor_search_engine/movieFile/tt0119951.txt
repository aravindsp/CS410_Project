 Private Parts (1997)Summaries The autobiographical story of Howard Stern, the radio rebel who is now also a TV personality, an author and a movie star. Having always wanted to be a disc-jockey, Howard Stern works his way painfully from radio at his 1970's college to a Detroit station. It is with a move to Washington that he hits on an outrageous off-the-wall style that catches audience attention. Despite his on-air blue talk, at home he is a loving husband. He needs all the support he can get when he joins NBC in New York and comes up against a very different vision of radio. Jeremy Perkins {J-26} It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
