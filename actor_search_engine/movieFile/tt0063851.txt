 Cmo est el servicio! (1968)Summaries Vicenta Verruguillo came to Madrid to work as a bridesmaid. She's not very lucky when searching for a house to work in... Vicenta is a copy of "modern slave": She left her hometown, Villarrioso, province of Cceres, to work as a maid in Madrid. His cousin Manolo is also in the city, and, on behalf of Vicenta's mother, is dedicated to protecting her from men. For his part, Manolo works as a certified health worker in an ambulance, and turns out to have no less than 12 girlfriends at a time, which he calls indistinctly "Pichurri". Meanwhile, Vicenta is trying her luck as a housekeeper in different houses, without finding what she is looking for in any of them, until she meets the radiologist Dr. Cifuentes, who lives with her parents, Mariano (also a doctor) and Consuelo. He falls madly in love with him, and stays to work as a maid for his family. The arrival of Vicenta at the home of the Cifuentes is providential, and so much so that the father advises the son to pretend to be in love with her in order to retain her as a servant.
