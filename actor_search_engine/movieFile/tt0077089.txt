Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> This Emmy-winning sitcom follows the lives of a group of cabbies in New York. The employees of the Sunshine Cab Company are a motley crew, including frustrated actor Bobby, struggling boxer Tony, art gallery receptionist Elaine, and tyranical dispatcher Louie. For almost everyone, the cab company is just a temporary job that can be left behind when they make it in their chosen professions. The core of the company is disillusioned Alex, who's sure he will be driving a cab for the rest of his life. Burned-out ex-hippie minister Reverend Jim and mechanic Latka Gravas round out the group.
