 Stalked by My Neighbor (2015 TV Movie)Summaries A mother and her 18-year-old daughter move to suburbia to help recover from a traumatic home invasion, but a sinister shadow seems to be stalking them. Thriller about a single mom and her daughter who move from a West Hollywood condo to a supposedly safe neighborhood (after the daughter is attacked in the condo by a neighbor). The troubles just continue in the new place. Who is the real stalker? Unemployed, hot car mechanic Nick Thompkin has mixed feelings about the new neighbor girl, student Jodi Allen, who moved to his quiet suburb from Hollywood with her devoted single mother Andrea, ignoring she was traumatized by a campus rapist, who was eliminated but remains their nightmarish obsession. Jodi immediately accuses Nick of 'stealing' her camera, which she abuses to sneak-stalk the whole street, actually just dealing with shirtless pictures of himself, while somewhat flattered. When neighbor Lisa Miller, a real estate agent who constantly complained absurdly about Nick to the police, is murdered at home, Jodi again accuses Nick, without any evidence, and starts spying on him, only to find out he's a nice guy and change her mind, again suspiciously in police and even maternal eyes, about Nick who gets a job and becomes her boyfriend. New suspects are Lisa' in-living orphan niece and heiress, Kristen Chambers, and her secret lover Ted Wilcox. KGF Vissers It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
