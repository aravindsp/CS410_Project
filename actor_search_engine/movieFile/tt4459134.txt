 Frank and Penelope (2022)Summaries A tale of love and violence when a man on his emotional last legs finds a savior seductively dancing in a run-down strip club. And a life most certainly headed off a cliff suddenly becomes redirected - as EVERYTHING is now worth dying for. In the spirit of THELMA and LOUISE and TRUE ROMANCE comes FRANK and PENELOPE, a once in a lifetime love story that stretches across the scorching east Texas blacktop when a man, Frank, on his emotional last legs finds his savior and soulmate, Penelope, seductively dancing on a wobbly brass pole in a run-down strip club. And, a life most certainly headed off a cliff is redirected by the type of love that most call mad. But, unwinding each other's troubled life threads creates knots that threaten to strangle the place where all the veins meet when they sit down at a charismatic, sin-eating cult leader's truth table and unpack each other's cluttered closets. And, deciding what to run from and what to run to becomes a bloody battle between life and love in their newfound world in which EVERYTHING is now worth dying for.
