 Who's the Boss? (19841992)Summaries Tony Micelli, a retired baseball player, becomes the housekeeper of Angela Bower, an advertising executive in New York. Together they raise their kids, Samantha Micelli and Jonathan Bower, with help from Mona Robinson, Angela's man-crazy mother. Former major-league baseball player Tony Micelli and his daughter, Samantha, arrive at the Connecticut household of executive Angela Bower, where Tony has taken a job as live-in housekeeper. The Bowers are an interesting family, to say the least. Angela is uptight and obsessed with her work. Her son, Jonathan, is shy and lacks self-esteem, and her mother, Mona Robinson, is a man-hungry vixen. Tony soon wins them over with his laid-back style, and they soon begin to loosen up. Over time, romantic tensions begin to surface between Angela and Tony, and we see the children grow up. Jason A. Cormier <wildrose@mindspring.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
