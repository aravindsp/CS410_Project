 Spotless (2005)Summaries For Martin Palado, the self-made millionaire, failure is not an option. Since his retirement, Martin's mind has led him to dark obsessions. Posing as a bum, he panhandles on the streets of Denver. When Martin fails at begging, he falls back on his old habit of hiring Jackson Hash to remove his competition. Jackson carries his reputation as a brutal killer proudly. If the money is right, no life is too sacred. After one particularly bloody hit, Jackson has an epiphany about his life. He reforms himself, opening his own business, where he befriends Johnny Stockman and is invited to join his weekly craps game. During the game, Jackson realizes that his life hasn't really come clean, and all their lives are changed forever. Spacedog It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
