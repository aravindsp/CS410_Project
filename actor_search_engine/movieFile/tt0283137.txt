 White Cargo (1973)Summaries Albert is a bumbling civil servant, who dreams that he is a Bond-like secret agent. He gets involved in a plot to smuggle young women out to the Middle East. More by luck than judgment he manages to thwart the baddies and save the day. David Jason's most famous film appearance of the 1970's was opposite Graham Chapman in 'The Odd Job' but five years earlier he played the lead role in this very low budget comedy. His character is a daydreamer but he manages to get caught up in an adventure involving the hugely underated Imogen Hassall. There is even an appearance from a pre Darth Vader Dave Prowse although his character closer resembles the one he played in 'Callan'. <timbishopgb@excite.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
