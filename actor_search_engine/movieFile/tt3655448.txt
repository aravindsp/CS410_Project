 The Young Pope (2016)Summaries The beginning of the pontificate of Lenny Belardo, alias Pius XIII, the first American Pope in history. Young and charming, newly elected Pius XIII, aka Lenny Belardo, is the first American Pope in history. His ascension appears to be the result of a simple, effective media strategy implemented by the College of Cardinals. In the Vatican, however, the prevailing wisdom is the church's leaders have chosen a mysterious figure as their guiding force. And Pius XIII proves to be the most mysterious and contradictory of them all. As Belardo begins his reign, he is stubbornly resistant to the Vatican stewards, instead relying on Sister Mary to serve as his chief adviser. While she urges him to focus on leading his billion followers, the young pope shows little interest in making himself known, either to the College of Cardinals or to the masses. The 10-episode drama series stars Jude Law in the title role and Diane Keaton as Sister Mary, a nun from the U.S. now living in Vatican City. The young cardinal Lenny Belardo, who appears in the position of the Pope, is a miracle. He is 47, for the Pope this is an unthinkable youth. The elderly cardinals hope that the "youth" can be easily controlled, but it wasn't there: the young pontiff shows rare obstinacy and waywardness. He is not going to change his habits, his narcissism sometimes surpasses all conceivable limits, and the attitude towards God is often incomprehensible not only to his environment, but also to himself. Lenny was promoted to the post of Pope because he never had his opinion, was quiet and obedient, courteous and polite, invisible and modest. He always did as the instructor instructed him, and did not show disobedience in anything. Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
