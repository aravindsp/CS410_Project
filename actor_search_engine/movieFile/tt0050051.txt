Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. Based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner, "Perry Mason" was one of the most popular shows on television. Raymond Burr starred as the indefatigable attorney who rarely lost a case. His confidential secretary, Della Street (Barbara Hale) and private investigator sidekick Paul Drake (William Hopper), formed an alliance that real-life attorneys would have envied. Perry defended rich and poor alike and was famous for coming up with a last-minute piece of evidence that ensured his clients' innocence. There was no romance between Perry and Della, although their admiration for each other was obvious. Little was known about their private lives. Rounding out the cast was William Talman as district attorney Hamilton Burger and Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg of the police force.
