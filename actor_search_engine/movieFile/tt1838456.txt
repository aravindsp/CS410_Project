 Autumn of Route 66 (2013)Summaries Visually stunning experience that will leave you feeling like you just experienced Route 66 road trip yourself. The journey of America's oldest highway has been documented many times, but never from this point of view. Sometimes funny, sometimes ironic and sometimes sad but always true, this film goes far beyond simple journey. America's history and culture are mirrored in this interesting project that speaks to children as well as adults. Ester Brym It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
