 Dead Write (2007)Summaries After driving husband Martin to infidelity and catching him at it, mentally-unstable author Jade returns to her New Zealand home to write a book based on the town's history, helped by the local schoolteacher and her college thesis protge, and also visit her father Christopher. As her editor later explains, her suspicions concerning ever more locals stem from a pathological mental condition. However, more then just paranoia comes with the horse-riding incident that killed her ma, that causes obsessive guilt for her and her father. KGF Vissers I agree that the script was convoluted and poorly presented. In fact some of the crucial plot lines were inaudible to even the staff writing the subscripts. But with the right director and editing staff the plot has the potential to be a very interesting movie that plays with your mind on mental illness, ghosts, purgatory and reincarnation. If you didn't see the last frame after all the credits just before the film goes dark, you missed the whole point of the movie. LaVerl Wilhelm It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
