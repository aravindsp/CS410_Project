 Til Death Do Us Part (1995)Summaries Alex is an author, well over 30, who still hasn't found the love of his life. Then his therapist advises him to look up the last woman he ever loved. So he travels back to the place of his birth. In this wild romantic comedy, Alex is a burned-out writer in his mid-thirties who consults a psychiatrist to help him discover the source of his writer's block. The psychiatrist decides that Alex's writing problems are linked to a lack of romance in his life. As a solution, she recommends that Alex find the last woman that he ever really loved! The last woman Alex fell for is Joanne, his high-school girlfriend. Alex returns to his hometown to find Joanne and enlists the help of his old friend, Paul, a notorious ladies man and now the owner of a funeral home, who also happens to be Joanne's ex-husband. Once Alex sees Joanne again, he realizes that he needs her back in his life. To make matters worse, Paul also wants to reunite with Joanne, and is extremely reluctant to help Alex 'win her back'. Joanne, meanwhile, is about to marry another man, whom both Alex and Paul think is completely wrong for her. With the odds against Alex, and the fact that Joanne can't stand him, he pursues his quest to get to the bottom of his creative block, and perhaps to find true love again.
