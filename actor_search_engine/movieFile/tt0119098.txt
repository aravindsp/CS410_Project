 Fall (1997)Summaries Cab driver Michael and supermodel Sarah fall in love while her gorgeous husband Phillippe is in Madrid for two months. Two people from completely different worlds meet by chance, thrown together as if by fate. Their attraction is immediately obvious and overwhelming. He is attracted to her beauty (she is a supermodel) and good humor; she is seduced by his charisma and honesty. With his gifts of poetry and tenderness, he opens her heart to the possibility of true love. But it takes a lot of courage to make a commitment. Is she truly in love with him? And even if she is, will she able to leave the cosmopolitan, superficial lifestyle to be with him? <amity@lungfish.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
