Harald Mayr <marvin@bike.augusta.de> Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. This is a very exciting show. It has action, pretty women and handsome men, science fiction, and very good stories which also relate to our lives here on earth. Captain Kirk is a famous Captain. He is the youngest Captain in the United Federation of Planets, or Federation for short. The enemies of the Federation are many, but two races which stand out are the Romulans and the Klingons. Both of these races are warlike, but they have different appearances. The first officer on Captain Kirk's ship, the Enterprise, is a Vulcan named Mr. Spock. Vulcans are known for their logic and lack of emotion. Sometimes logic works and sometimes human emotion is needed. Mr. Spock's mother was Human, so Spock does have some emotion. Also in the ship's crew are Dr. McCoy, an American Surgeon; Mr. Scott, or "Scotty", a Scottish Engineer; Mr. Sulu, an Asian Helmsman; Mr. Chekov, a Russian Navigator; Lt. Uhura, a female African Communications Officer; and Nurse Christine Chapel, a blonde female Nurse. There are, of course, many other crew members, and because the missions are dangerous, some of the men and women die in the course of investigations. You will learn about all of these men and women when you watch the show. It is very exciting, and it is also enjoyable to see the costumes that they wear, the Enterprise uniforms, and the crazy costumes that the alien men and women wear. There are many TV series and movies about the Enterprise and other Federation ships, but this original series is by far the best one. The special effects are not as complex as modern movies, but the stories are much more interesting. If you cannot obtain these shows on DVD or on your TV I will write synopses of each episode and try to entertain you so that you will want to see them someday. I recommend that you try to see them. You will enjoy them very much.
