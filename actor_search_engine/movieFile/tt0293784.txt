 CinMagique (2002)Summaries George is a modern-day traveler literally stuck in movie history, looking for a way out. Ever so soon having fallen in love with Marguerite, he stumbles from one film classic into another, taking him from the silent movie era right through the high tech blockbusters of the late 1990's. Every now and then George bumps into Marguerite once again so he can further kindle his blooming affair with her. As the journey unfolds, the audience literally won't stay untouched and will wonder just as hard as George and Marguerite do: where does it all end?
