 Rejseholdet (20002004)Summaries A mobile task force is dispatched across Denmark to help local police solve tough cases. Members of the flying squad are away from home 230 days a year. We follow their fascinating yet frightening work in the underworld, their commitment and affectionate solidarity. Based on real criminal cases from the last decade, there's something special about these people, who boast one of the highest success rates in the world. Yet how do marriages and families cope with their long absences? When a female police commissioner who has ambitions on behalf of her gender selects detective Ingrid Dahl as the new head of a Danish police travel unit, it does not come without problems for the young detective. She struggles to unite career and family, and she has to establish a cooperation with a team of detectives including the man who had expected to take her job. However, the initial uncertainty soon turns to trust and even friendship, and the team proves its worth investigating the nation's most vicious cases of murder and violent crime.
