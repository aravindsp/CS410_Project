Great and important movie about the German-German Cold War history. Or did you know that East-German spies never were prosecuted in the re-united Germany (they never broke laws of their country, the German Democratic Republic) while those Federal Republic of Germany residents who were instrumentalized to work for them were sentenced to partly severe punishments (treason)? Romeo describes the subtle mechanisms that Ministerium fr Staatssicherheit (=East German Secret Service) handsome men (Romeos) applied to make West German woman work for them in ministries or other key public or industry positions, passing on confidential information. Martina Gedeck plays an awesome part as woman and mother who simply wants to have a good live ending up between all frontlines. Even her wedding to her Romeo was a fake Stasi Make-Believe. Great drama, great acting and a Must-see for all those interested in German-German history.
