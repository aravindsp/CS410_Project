 The 12th Man (2017)55) They were 12 saboteurs. The Nazis killed 11 of them. This is the true story of the one that got away. True World War II story about Jan Baalsrud, one of the 12 saboteurs sent in 1943 from England to the Nazi occupied Northern Norway. After their boat is sunk by the Germans, Jan goes on the run towards the neutral Sweden. However, the brutal weather conditions turn out to possibly be an even greater foe than the Nazi patrols. Fact is stranger than fiction in this WW2 drama. The bravery of the main character is perhaps only overshadowed by the bravery of those helping him escape the Nazis hunting him. The scenery is breathtaking and you can feel the cold which is the greater enemy in this tale of survival against innumerable odds. A lesson in the goodness of human nature. mickyc-01642 Above the Arctic Circle in Northern Norway, the dramatic story of the young resistance fighter, Jan Baalsrud, unfolds. Jan is the only one out of twelve resistance fighters to escape the Germans, but the Gestapo is on his heels. Jan's moral fibre, incredible strength, and his courageous countrymen keep him alive. But when he seeks refuge in a mountain cave and ends up being trapped by a blizzard for two weeks, all hope seems lost. Nevertheless, Jan is recovered, weak, frostbitten and barely alive, but one question remains - will he make it to neutral Sweden before the Germans find him? March, 1943. Twelve British-trained Norwegian saboteurs are ambushed by German troops when they enter Norway. Eleven of the saboteurs are either captured or killed. The twelfth, Jan Baalsrud, manages to escape the trap but now there is a massive German manhunt out for him.
