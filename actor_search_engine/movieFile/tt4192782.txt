 Glitch (20152019)Summaries Six people return from the dead with no memory and attempt to unveil what brought them to the grave in the first place. A police officer in a small town is called out to the local cemetery in the middle of the night. He makes a discovery that turns his world upside down: six people have risen from the dead in perfect health. Bisho James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) is a small town policeman. He is called to the local cemetery in the middle of the night, after six people have inexplicably risen from the dead in perfect health. With no memory of their identities, they are determined to discover who they are and what has happened to them. James and one of them recognise each other, and along with local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly), James struggles to keep the case hidden from his colleagues, his family, and the world. The six people are all linked in some way, and the search begins for someone who knows the truth about how and why they have returned. Sikured419 It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
