 The New Adventures of Robin Hood (19971999)Summaries The legendary outlaw and his Merry Men battle evil around Nottingham and Sherwood Forest. Robin Hood and his band of outlaws which includes Marian, Little John, and Friar Tuck, rob from the rich and give to the poor as they fight against Prince John, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and all other manner of evil people and creatures. Magic plays as much a part as the sword and the arrow. Mike "Nelson" Gulick <dagger@tiac.net> Once Merlin had made a prophecy to Arthur that another good man would help England. A couple hundred years later, one of Merlin's followers named Olwyn finds a boy of nobility named Robert who's full of hate at the men who killed his father. From this a new legend is born and from the bitter lad grows a strong leader who fights for the common man. With him are Little John, Friar Tuck, and of course, Maid Marion whom he is always denying his feelings for. They protect all from taxes, tyranny, and black magic.
