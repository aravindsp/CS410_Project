 Simon & Simon (19811989)Summaries Two brothers of disparate tastes and manners run a private detective agency. A.J. Simon is a polished fellow with a taste for classic cars and tailored suits. Rick Simon is his less refined (but still pleasant) older brother who has a taste for cowboy boots and four-wheel drive pickups. The two of them live in San Diego, where they own a private detective agency. The series chronicles their exploits. Afterburner <aburner@erols.com> A.J. and Rick Simon are brothers and private investigators but are as different as night and day. A.J.'s went to law school, while Rick's a Vietnam vet, who knows a lot of people on the other side of the law, which comes handy in their line of work. While A.J. likes to do things by the book, Rick likes to do things his way. In the show's first season, their office was in front of the office of Fowler Investigations, which is runned by Myron Fowler and his daughter, Janet, who just happens to be A.J.'s former girlfriend. Occasionally, they competed with Fowler, other times they turned to him and/or Janet for help, and vice versa. During the second season, Fowler retired and closed his agency and Janet joined the D.A.'s office. During the third season Janet was replaced by Detective Downtown Brown, who got involved, sometimes reluctantly, with the Simons' cases and bailed them out when they got in trouble with the police. After four seasons, Tim Reid who played Brown left the show. So he was replaced by Abby Marsh. Also Simon's mother, Cecilia, occasionally got involved with their cases or brought them some. <rcs0411@yahoo.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
