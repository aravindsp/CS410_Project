Romi encourages a bitter Karan to continue with his aim but urges him not to join the army out of anger at his father. However, Karan remains firm in his decision and expresses his desire to marry Romi in the future to which Romi consents. Karan's father is dubious of his selection and convinces his worried wife that Karan will return in a few days.

Devastated, Karan finally comes to terms with his situation and makes his decision. He returns to the IMA, takes his punishment, becomes a focused, disciplined officer cadet and eventually commissions into the Indian Army as a lieutenant. Karan is posted to the 3rd battalion of the Punjab Regiment, commanded by the charismatic Col. Sunil Damle (Amitabh Bachchan). The force is stationed in Kargil. Karan quickly befriends and earns the respect of his fellow battalion members. Later Karan comes home on leave and is heartbroken to find out that Romi is getting engaged to a wealthy executive. But his leave is cut short, and he's recalled to his battalion due to an outbreak of hostilities in Kargil. He reports back to his battalion, where he's promoted to the rank of acting Captain. Col. Damle briefs the officers on the latest situation and reveals that several infiltrators have crossed the Line of Control from Pakistan and occupied mountain peaks on the Indian side of the border. The battalion has been assigned to secure Point 5179, a crucial vantage point dominating the army's main supply line, the National Highway 1D. The battalion decides to attack from the eastern side of the mountain. The first part of the assault is successful. The battalion destroys the enemy's screening units with Karan cited for his bravery in saving another officer's life. Meanwhile, Romi gets stationed to Kargil as a war correspondent, when her fiance forbids her to go there, she breaks off the engagement. Romi goes to Kargil, where she meets the now mature and responsible Karan. Romi begins to fall in love with Karan again. However, Karan remains reluctant to return her feelings as he's still hurt over her previous rejection of him and under the impression that she's engaged. In the second phase of the assault, the battalion attacks the peak of the mountain but fails to capture it due to the strategic advantage and heavy weaponry the Pakistanis have. The unit suffers heavy casualties, and Karan is devastated to lose many of his friends in the attack. Brigadier Puri summons Col. Damle and reluctantly agrees to give him 48 hours to capture the peak. After that time, responsibility for the Point will be given to another battalion. Col. Damle orders a group of 12 officers and soldiers (including Karan) to scale the 1000-foot rock cliff on the western side of the mountain and flank the enemy stronghold. They will be provided with artillery support from the eastern side. Karan realizes that he has finally found his goal in the form of capturing the peak and assures Damle he will succeed, whether he lives or dies. Later, Karan phones his father and reconciles with him, and his father expresses his pride for his son's bravery on the battlefield. Karan also learns of Romi's failed engagement via a letter sent by his friend Ashu and expresses his feelings for her. Romi promises Karan she will wait for him whether he returns or not. The unit sets off on their mission, and while moving through a grass field toward the rock cliff, they come under fire. The group discovers a Pakistani mortar unit in the area and destroys it but loses their commanding officer and several soldiers. The team's radios are also damaged, so they cannot communicate with battalion HQ. Out of the initial 12, only six remain. They decide to continue with the mission. They successfully scale the cliff and attack the Pakistani position during the night. Their assault is successful although Karan is wounded, and the team loses three more men. The next morning, Karan limps to the peak, where he plants the Indian flag and fires a flare, signaling to an ecstatic Col. Damle that they have captured the peak. The film ends with Karan leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents, and his father proudly embraces him. Karan's father then reveals that Romi has also arrived to see Karan. He walks over to a smiling Romi and she asks what's next now he has accomplished his aim. Karan states he has another Lakshya, which is Romi, and they happily embrace each other.
