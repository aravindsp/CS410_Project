 Land of Hunted Men (1943)Summaries The Range Busters arrive to see if they can find out who has been robbing the stage of the mine payrolls. Crash is a big winner in Faro Wilson's card game and when the winning bills are later checked, they are found to be from the mine payroll. When the mine manager is seen sneaking into Faro's office, the Range Busters know how Faro learns of the shipments and they are ready when the next payroll goes out. Maurice VanAuken <mvanauken@a1access.net> The Range Busters, "Crash" Corrigan, Denny Moore and "Alibi" Terhune, are hanging out in a shack preparatory to entering a town to clean up a gang of mail robbers. Denny happens upon a robbery, tries to stop it and is wounded when he is chased by the supposed vigilantes who are in reality members of the gang. They trail him to the shack, but "Crash" and "Alibi" conceal him. They send their cook, "Snowflake" to town, and "Crash" and "Alibi" also go there to see Sheriff Wallace. While there, they drop in at the saloon ran by "Faro" Wilson and win so much money that "Faro" picks a fight to recover his money. "Crash" and "Alibi" escape, and "Snowflake" retrieves the money and also hangs around long enough to overhear that "Faro" plans to rob the mail coach again and that Pelham, respected citizen and mine manager, is the secret man behind the gang robbing his own payrolls. Meanwhile, "Crash" , Denny and "Alibi"---and "Elmer"--- are hanging out over at Rancher Oliver's house, and "Crash" and "Denny" are making a heavy play at trying to score with his daughter, Dorrie. This goes on for a while and then all hands saddle up and ride to prevent the stagecoach hold-up. Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
