 Pearl: A Fashion Film by Brandon Jameson (2017)Summaries A young girl sees the beauty of life through the eyes of her Grandmother. Right Where It Belongs Treasure without measure, a peach-hued pearl necklace, an heirloom passed on for three generations, is in my possession, wrapped in purple velvet inside a white satin jewelry bag drawn and tied with white braided cord, right where it belongs, safe, secure, in my dresser unless I wear it for special occasions. Often admired for its rare beauty, I'm proud to say it was my great grandmother's set of pearls, standing the test of time, handled lovingly and gently by her, by my mother, now me.
