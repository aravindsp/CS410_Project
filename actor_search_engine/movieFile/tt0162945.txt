 Embrace the Darkness (1999)321) Vampires descend upon Los Angeles in search of victims to join their cult. Galan (Kevin Spirtas) and Miranda (Angelia High) are a couple with an unusual secret: they're vampires living in modern-day Los Angeles who are looking for new victims to join them in the legions of the undead. But when Galan falls for beautiful Jennifer (Madison Clark), a mortal woman, Miranda feels threatened by her new rival. Miranda seduces Jennifer, but Jennifer is more strongly attracted to Galan, who has promised to give her eternal life. Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. Vampires Galen [Kevin Spirtas] and Miranda [Angelina High] have just moved to Los Angeles. Galen wants to lay low and get his blood from a nearby bloodbank while Miranda likes hers fresh, young, and virile. When Galen notices dancer Jennifer [Madison Clark] masturbating on her studio floor, he falls in love and sets out to pursue her. Miranda becomes jealous and seduces Jennifer, too, while Jennifer's cop boyfriend Ryan [Brad Bartram] senses that she is becoming too friendly with Galen and Miranda. Meanwhile, Ryan and Detective Turner [Cliff Potts] have their hands full trying to figure out why bloodless bodies keep turning up with two puncture wounds on the neck. Then Jennifer is hit by a car, and Galen "saves" her by making her a vampire. When Ryan sees a wanted poster bearing a drawing of Galen, he grabs a stake and rushes over to Galen's apartment, only to find Jennifer squating in a corner and crying. Does Ryan use that stake on Jennifer? You'll have to wait for Embrace the Darkness 2 to find out.
