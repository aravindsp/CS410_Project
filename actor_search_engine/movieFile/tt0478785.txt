Tesseract draws a line between photographer Eadweard Muybridge's obsession with photographing movement and his act of jealous murder in 1873. Muybridge's life and work became a fracturing of time where duration is sliced, mechanized, and stopped from flowing - this was a temporal insanity that led to cinema itself: the re-animation of the frozen image. Muybridge's form, a spatial layout of time, is used here in film. The screen is split into panels, a moving photographic layout, fracturing our perspective of time, and the narrative of Muybridge's life. tesseract : a four dimensional cinema-cube stretching through time.
