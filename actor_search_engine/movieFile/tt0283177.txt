 Combat Missions (2002 )Summaries The most exciting reality series ever produced and, sadly, seen by very few. Teams comprised of elite military and law enforcement Warriors compete in combat missions that take place in various situations from urban to desert combat. Each team plans and executes the assigned mission. Competitors are voted off the show by other team members. The remaining two competitors are pitted against each other in one final combat mission. This show epitomizes the brains, brawn, attitude, and never ending will power it takes to reach the level of a United States Superior Warrior. It is extremely high energy action, emotion, education, adventure, suspense, and entertainment. Lynette Abbott It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
