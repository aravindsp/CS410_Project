Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. It is a duel. A man escaping from his past, pursued by the Beast that will haunt him and destroy those around him until he finally honors a lovers vow and confronts his destiny. Imagine an adventurous young couple, teenagers escaping the world of consumerism and comfortable conformity by playing the game of infiltration, the practice of entering into dangerous situations in which you dont belong. They do it just for the rush, the adrenaline rush, the pure passion for life, for love, as only the young can love. A love more important than life itself. But infiltrating a boatload of immigrants who are washed up on a dangerous shore, a land ruled by the merciless iron fist of Colonel Kufard, takes the lovers beyond the dangers of the game and into a nightmare realm of violence and damnation. A new game with new rules played to the death. A desperate fugitive, running from the past, pursued by ROTT, the beast that stops at nothing to carry out the order to kill. A rottweiler left for dead that comes back ever stronger, with fangs and jaws of steel and a single-minded bloodlust. Reinforced with modern technology and possessed of an ancient evil that will not die until it has devoured the heart and possessed the soul of its prey. A chase across a landscape of terror where there is no friend, no refuge, no respite from relentless violence and cruelty,... there is only the hunter and the hunted.
