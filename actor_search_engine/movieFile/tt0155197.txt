 Speedway Junky (1999)Summaries Johnny wants to be a stock car racer one day. He meets a young, gay hustler in Vegas, who takes him to meet his friends/gang and his "mom", an ex hooker etc. A naive drifter runs away from his army father in hopes of making it on the car racing circuit. In Las Vegas, he meets a young scam artist, who develops a crush on him. He is then introduced to a whole gang led by a young hustler. The racer-to-be then gets a lesson in the wild side, getting involved in one situation after another. Patsy Kensit makes a cameo as another hustler and Daryl Hannah appears as the scam artist's surrogate mom. John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
