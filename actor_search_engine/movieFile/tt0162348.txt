 Smiling Fish & Goat on Fire (1999)Summaries Two brothers share a house in the Fairfax district of LA: Tony a feckless actor, Chris an accountant. Both have relationships on rocky ground. As these emotions swirl, Tony meets his letter carrier, a single-mom named Kathy who's come to LA from Wyoming with her daughter, a budding actress. Chris meets Anna, an Italian beauty working in the States, for a few months, wrangling animals on movie sets. Chris also befriends Clive, an aging, crusty man whose longing for his recently-deceased wife is a portrait of true love. Can Clive's example help Chris sort out his love life, and can Tony grow up enough to see the possibilities with Kathy and her daughter? <jhailey@hotmail.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
