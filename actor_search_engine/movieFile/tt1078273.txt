 Sordid Lives: The Series (2008 )Summaries A prequel to the film of the same name, focusing on the exploits of an eccentric Texan family. The story of Bible-thumping Baptists, beer-swilling bar trash, and everyone in-between in a small Texas town, contrasted with the appearance-driven world of Hollywood and the hysterical comedy and tender poignancy that come from learning to be yourself and love the family you have instead of the family you want. fitzwilliam It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
