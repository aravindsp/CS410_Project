 The Truth Commissioner (2016)Summaries A drama about a truth commissioner appointed to chair a South African style truth commission in Northern Ireland. Henry Stanfield is the new Truth Commissioner in Northern Ireland. Part of his job is to facilitate the peaceful sharing of power in Belfast. However, the investigation into the murder of a teenage boy, who acted as an informer, brings to light more buried secrets than either London or Dublin want to become known, and various people, both at home in Ireland and as far away as America, find out that old sins cast long shadows. Lonely, widowed diplomat Henry Stanfield, anxious to repair the rift with daughter Emma, is appointed the truth commissioner by the British prime minister and sent to Northern Ireland, a principal task being to determine the fate of Connor Roche, a youngster who disappeared twenty years earlier, presumed killed by the I.R.A. as an informer. The chief suspect, Michael Madden, is now living in America but Connor's sister Maria and mother welcome Henry's investigation as they believe there was a cover-up. He immediately spars with the chief constable and detects that his assistant Laura has had dinner with Jake Marston, who is a spy. Official witnesses are not always immediately helpful - including former Sinn Fein member, now politician Francis Gilroy and retired RUC chief James Fenton. To Henry uncovering the truth is paramount but so too is his effort to reconcile with his daughter. don @ minifie-1 It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
