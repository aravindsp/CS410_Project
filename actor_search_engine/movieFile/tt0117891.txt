 A Thin Line Between Love and Hate (1996)Summaries A fast paced, womanizing nightclub promoter gets paid back in full when he scorns a beautiful woman with psychotic tendencies who will punish him for breaking her heart. An observable, fast-talking party man Darnell Wright, gets his punishment when one of his conquests takes it personally and comes back for revenge in this 'Fatal Attraction'-esque comic thriller. Anonymous Darnell Wright (Martin Lawrence) has a way with the ladies- both figuratively and literally. Darnell begins to feel like he hit the jackpot when he meets Brandi Web (Lynn Whitfield), who starts off playing hard to get, until she eventually gives in to Darnell's advances. But when Darnell reconnects with Mia (Regina King), a longtime friend, he begins to form a stable and committed relationship with her. Immediately, he tosses out not only his other relationships with a few other women, but also tosses out his relationship with Brandi. Brandi immediately becomes unstable and starts stalking him. But things get really personal when Brandi starts threatening Mia, forcing Darnell to see the error of his ways and ultimately learning to stop trying to be "the" man and become "a" man.
