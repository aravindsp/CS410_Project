 Workin' Moms (2017 )Summaries Four very different thirtysomething working-mother friends try to balance their jobs, family lives, and love lives in modern-day Toronto, Canada. Workin' Moms follows the lives of four women as they juggle love, careers, and parenthood. They support, challenge, and try not to judge one another as life throws them curveballs. Whether it is an identity crisis, a huge job opportunity, postpartum depression, or an unplanned pregnancy, they face good and bad with grace and humor. Kate is the flawed, fearless heart-and-soul of the series, who has stark home/life decisions to make. She relies on her closest friend Anne, a no-nonsense psychiatrist and mother of two, who is facing a massive family challenge. Charming, unpredictable Frankie livens any dark moment as she struggles with her own instability and relationship malaise. And sweet former sorority-girl Jenny seeks an uncharacteristically-reckless awakening. Together the friends fearlessly confront the polarizing, unexpected realities of being working moms.
