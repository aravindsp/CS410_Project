Josh Pasnak <chainsaw@intouch.bc.ca> At a ten year high school reunion, Jeff meets his old high school flame, Angela. Angela was flaky even then but now she may have gone over the edge. The only emotional and sexual excitement she gets comes from a series of "dares" which she imposes on Jeff. These dares, which at first take the form of light sexual escapades, become more and more intense. And this combination of sex and danger eventually turns into a deadly game of erotic cat-and-mouse.
