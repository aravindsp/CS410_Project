 The Infiltrators (2019)Summaries A rag-tag group of undocumented youth - Dreamers - deliberately get detained by Border Patrol in order to infiltrate a shadowy, for-profit detention center. Marco and Viri are members of the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, a progressive arm of DREAMers determined to bring to light the unreported story of the targeted arrests, lengthy detentions, and deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records in the highly lucrative - and equally controversial - Broward County detention facility. Risking their own deportation, the two activists go undercover, orchestrating their own arrests, while covertly coordinating the legal release of immigrants detained by the privatized facility. Winner of both the 'NEXT Innovator' and 'Audience Award' at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, THE INFILTRATORS weaves together documentary footage of the real infiltrators with moving re-enactments to tell the inspirational true story of young DREAMers tapping into the power of crowd-sourced activism while illustrating the need for compassion in the evolving dynamics of immigration reform.
