 Totally Baked (2007)Summaries Meet Dave Bertman, a tightly wound 37 year-old father of one. Bertman's "higher" education begins when medical marijuana activists wielding "loaded" weapons interrupt a planned reunion barbecue with college debate chums. When his teenage daughter Gina Marie unexpectedly arrives with a joint found in her pocket, Bertman assumes the worst. Only after he faces his own hypocrisies, can he have the open and honest discussion needed for father and daughter to understand each other and reconnect. Meanwhile, Bertman's fellow debaters shed their inhibitions and make their own self-discoveries. Tired of seeing her grass-roots campaigns sabotaged by corporations opposing legalization, pro-pot advocate, Dr. Willa Peterson decides the kid gloves are coming off. By convincing the Fun-0nion snack food empire their sales would skyrocket if marijuana was legal, Peterson enlists their corporate might to back her cause. It will take a radical marketing campaign to change the way America thinks about marijuana, and PR guru, Arturo Goldman, of the famous PR firm Goldman, Goldberg, Goldstein, and Goldman comes up with one. "If they can use terrorists to convince people out of smoking pot, then we can use homosexuality to scare them back into it." The romp that follows leaves paranoid Bible thumpers scrambling to get their kids high to inhibit perceived homosexual tendencies. "Totally Baked" takes a satirical look at marijuana's stereotypes and mythologies using a compilation of "Man on the Street" true documentary style interviews, humorous insights by live stand-up comedians, and a series of interconnected vignettes spoofing both sides of the political debate over the legalization of marijuana.
