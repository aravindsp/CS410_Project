 City Homicide (20072011)Summaries Set on the Homicide floor of a police headquarters in Melbourne, Australia, detectives work to bring justice for the deceased. Set in the homicide squad of a large metropolitan city, this is a punchy one hour drama series about murder mystery and a group of young committed cops, focused on justice for the deceased. Jennifer Mapplethorpe, ambitious and intelligent; Simon Joyner, keen, cool, self-assured; Duncan Freeman, living high, ready to fall; and Matt Ryan, intense and driven. In Homicide, it's not always crooks and low-lives, most murders are committed by ordinary people - a moment of madness, a failure of communication, a desperate act. These Detectives follow a profession that makes blood, grief and drama just part of their normal day. Their day begins when your day ends. No greater honour will ever be bestowed upon an officer, than when they are entrusted with an investigation into the death of a human being. Seven's new series follows young Homicide Detectives Simon (Daniel MacPherson, Neighbours, Tripping Over), Duncan (Aaron Pedersen, Water Rats), Jennifer (Nadine Garner, Water Rats, Stingers) and Matt (Damien Richardson) as they try to deal with the reality of their jobs in their personal and professional lives.
