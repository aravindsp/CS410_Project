 Merlin (1998)Summaries Legendary wizard Merlin tells his story of his war against Queen Mab of the Sidhe and his creation of Camelot. The legend of King Arthur ( Paul Curran ), this time, from the perspective of the King's Wizard, Merlin ( Sam Neill ). Merlin is a creature born of pagan magic, living in a world converting to Christianity. Merlin is beside Arthur as he gains Excalibur, builds Camelot, and is betrayed by his wife, Guinevere (Lena Headey). Merlin and Arthur are menaced by the plots of Morgan Le Fey (Helena Bonham Carter), her son by Arthur, Mordred (Jason Done), and their cohorts. Through it all, Merlin tries to keep Arthur from the destructive path set by fate. Michael "Rabbit" Hutchison <rabhutch@spacestar.net> The Arthurian legend is again retold, only this time from the perspective of the life of Merlin ( Sam Neill ). The story begins with young Merlin being schooled in magic by the evil sorceress, Mab (Miranda Richardson), and her apprentice, Frik (Martin Short). Merlin ultimately rejects her tutelage setting up a war between them which leads to her attack on Arthur ( Paul Curran ). Unwittingly, Arthur impregnates his own half-sister, Morgan Le Fey (Helena Bonham Carter), which leads to the birth of Mordred (Jason Done), an evil son who ultimately destroys Camelot. Merlin also unwittingly leads to Camelot's destruction when he selects Lancelot (Jeremy Sheffield) to protect Guinevere (Lena Headey) based on mistaken information he gains from The Lady of the Lake (Miranda Richardson).
