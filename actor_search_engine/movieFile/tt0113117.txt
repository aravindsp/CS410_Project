Kate and Charlie have the perfect life planned out: buying a house, marriage, kids, the whole works. Kate's fear of flying keeps her in Canada while Charlie goes to Paris for a medical convention. While there Charlie is smitten by the lovely Juliette. He calls off his wedding to Kate and she nervously boards a plane to get him back. She ends up sitting next to the petty French thief Luc Teyssier. He hides a stolen necklace and smuggled grapevine in her bag to get it through customs.

Along the way, Kate and Luc begin to have feelings for each other, which change the course of their lives. poco loco Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. When Kate's (Meg Ryan) fianc; Charlie (Timothy Hutton) calls from Paris to tell her he's in love with another woman, Kate determines to do anything to get him back. She even overcomes her fear of flying so she can chase him down in the romantic city of lights. Then, while airborne, the panicky Kate meets Luc (Kevin Kline), a somewhat sleazy character who just happens to be a thief -- and who secretly plants a stolen possession in her bag. Luc intends to retrieve the loot when they land; unfortunately a conman grabs the bag first, thwarting Luc's well-laid plans. Soon he and Kate are frantically scouring the beautiful French countryside in hopes of getting back her precious carry-on. The romantic situation hardly goes smoothly, either: Kate continues her obsession with ex-fianc Charlie, while Charlie's new girlfriend takes a liking to Luc... who unexpectantly falls in love with the broken-hearted Kate.
