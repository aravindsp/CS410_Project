 Ten Inch Hero (2007)Summaries An artist gets a job at a beachside sandwich shop, where she hangs out with a techie, a flirt, a rocker, a hippie, and a Wiccan. Piper moves to Santa Cruz, California to go to the Institute of Art. When she was 15 she gave birth to a daughter, but had to put her up for adoption because she was too young to raise her. Years later she sees an article about a girl she thinks is her daughter, who lives in Santa Cruz, and applies for a job in a sandwich shop. As she works there she gets to know the staff. Tish is a babe, she tries to seduce every guy who comes into the shop, and she goes home with those who flirt back. Jen, a computer nerd who has a love affair online with a guy who calls himself fuzzy22. She's not as pretty as Tish and she struggles with self-confidence. And there's a crazy haired guy called Priestly; he's not like other guys and dresses different then everyone because he refuses to be "another clone". Piper's boss is a really nice guy named Trucker, who's in love with a woman who owns the store across the street. The audience goes through the sandwich shop crew's personal struggles as they help each other through it all. Kine Johansen/liztothemax It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
