 Kung Phooey! (2003)Summaries The chosen one from China's mystical Shur-Li Temple embarks on a hilarious quest in this high-kicking spoof of kung-fu films from director Darryl Fong.

Assisted by a distant cousin, his best friend, Roy Lee (Colman Domingo), and the comely Sue Shee (Karena Davis), Art travels to the U.S. and must outwit the evil Helen Hu (Joyce Brew) and her henchment in order to complete his mission and earn the eternal respect of his wise, bald Masters.
