 The Unseen (I) (2010)Summaries When Scott takes Trisha on a drive, she is skeptical when he pulls up at an old abandoned farmhouse. He has heard rumors of a cool hangout and his curiosity gets the best of him when he opens the door and just walks in. Trisha is troubled when she sees a little girl that vanishes before her eyes, but when she makes it inside, this old house doesn't seem so abandoned...everything is in place, just - no people. It's as if the family living there has just recently gone out and might be back at any moment...they've just disappeared. Scott finds Native American relics and becomes more and more entranced in the mystery of the house, so, of course, he is ecstatic when he finds a working video camera and starts reviewing the tapes. He sees a family member filming his family in an otherwise harmless video. But as he continues to watch, he notices that these videos are more and more sinister. When the battery dies, Scott leaves Trisha inside to plug the camera into his truck and continue watching. Who is filming? Why are they hidden in the woods? What is he seeing?! He will begin to wish he had never discovered the house, the camera or the unseen dark secrets. Philip Ilami It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
