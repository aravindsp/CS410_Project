 Broken Badges (1990 )Summaries Jack Bowman is a cop from New Orleans who doesn't exactly play by the rules. When he is sent to California on a brief assignment, he is wrongfully blamed for something he didn't do. To get out of the jam he's in, he recruits cops who are on psychiatric leave, Bullet Tingreedes, a female cop who's addicted to danger, Stanley Jones, a cop who walks around with a ventriloquist dummy and who has a short fuse when people make fun of his stature, and Toby Baker, a kleptomaniac. After sorting things out, the Chief of Police decides to form a unit with Bowman and them. And a psychiatrist, Priscilla Mather keeps an eye on them. rcs0411@yahoo.com It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
