 Full Frontal (19931997)Summaries The series began screening shortly after the similar sketch comedy program Fast Forward (from which Full Frontal derived) ended. Full Frontal retained the same general format of Fast Forward. It was formatted in a way such as to create the effect of someone continuously channel surfing; after the punchline of each sketch, it would abruptly switch to the next as if the viewer had switched channels. zzzorf It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
