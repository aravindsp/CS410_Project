 Nio (2011)Summaries The Lopez-Aranza family are having hard times. The Villa Los Reyes Magos (The House of the Three Kings), their ancestral mansion which is the only remaining emblem of the past wealth and fame of the family, is slowly collapsing into a state of ruin. When former Congressman Gaspar goes into a coma, his opera elder sister Celia waits for a miracle through her grandson Antony clad in Sto, in "Nio" (Holy Infant Jesus) garb. But harsh reality falls on their children, Merced, Mombic, and Raquel, with the inevitable consequence: the impending sale of the mansion for a commercial venture. Celia wages her last battle to regain the glory of the past by hosting a splendid musical soiree, her final eulogy for her own moribund class. It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
