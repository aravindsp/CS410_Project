 On Location with: FAME (1980)Summaries A short film about the making of the movie "Fame." The movie Fame (1980) is aptly titled as it follows students at New York's School for the Performing Arts in their quest for fame in one of the most show business oriented cities in the world. This movie is director Alan Parker 's first ever to shoot in the US. Parker, in a letter to all cast members, describes why he sees this subject as being important: that the school's geographic location reminds the students both of the great successes to be had on the Great White Way, and the schlock, as he calls it, that populates 42nd Street. He believes that there is a fine line between success and failure in this world. Parker is also intrigued by the motivations behind what makes people, especially young people, want to perform. Individuals within the ensemble cast describe their own characters in the movie. Although there are several performances in the movie, the movie has a certain grounding, most specifically represented by the character of the English teacher, Mrs. Sherwood, played by Anne Meara .
