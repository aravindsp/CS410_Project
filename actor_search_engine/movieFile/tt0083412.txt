 Fame (19821987)Summaries The stories of the students and faculty of the New York City High School for the Performing Arts. The Art School was always their dream. They want to dance, they want to sing, to play music, to act but above all they want to live their lives while they are still young and full of energy. Leroy, Danny, Jesse, Chris, Coco and all the others try hard because they know that they've got a long way to go till they reach fame and riches. Fame costs and here (the Art School) is where they start paying for it. Xenophon Tsakanikas <ftpadmin@antigoni.med.auth.gr> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
