 The Dunwich Horror (1970)44) Wilbur Whateley travels to the Arkham Miskatonic University to borrow the legendary Necronomicon. But, little does anyone know, Whateley isn't quite human... H.P. Lovecraft meets Hollywood: Wilbur Whateley wants to help the Old Ones break through by consulting the Necronomicon, and Armitage must stop him. Brian Bixby <barbix@tiac.net> In the Arkam University, Dr. Henry Armitage has the infamous Necronomicon exposed in a glass box in the library. Dr. Armitage's assistants Nancy Wagner and Elizabeth Hamilton are closing the library, when Wilbur Whateley arrives and asks to consult the notorious book. Nancy is seduced by the young man and lends the Necronomicon to him. But soon Dr. Armitage arrives and guards the book in the glass box. Then they go to a restaurant and Wilbur says that he lives in Dunwich. When Dr. Armitage and Elizabeth leaves the restaurant, Nancy offers to drive him home. When they arrive at the Whateley's home, she accepts a spiked tea and Wilbur sabotages her car. Nancy decides to stay at his house, but she does not know that Wilbur wants to conjure the Old Ones and Nancy and the Necronomicon are essential for his purpose. Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Dr. Henry Armitage, Sandra Dee and another girl who wasn't in the book visit the library of the Miskatonic University where they are studying, and find a mysterious young man named Wilbur Whateley trying to borrow the Necronomicon (to non-HPL fans : a book containing ancient rites to bring alien gods to our planet), and as it is a public library they let him.
