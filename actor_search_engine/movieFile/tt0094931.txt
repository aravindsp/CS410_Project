 Cy Warrior (1989)Summaries Part man. Part robot. All ass kick. Unaffected by extreme heat and cold, impervious to bio-weapons and totally obedient, Cyber Warrior One will be the soldier of the future for the U.S. military. There's just one problem - he has a heart. Frank Zagarino plays Trecibi, a cyborg created in secret by the U.S. military to serve as the perfect assassin. However, unwilling to go along with this plan, the good-natured Trecibi escapes one day and runs into a young boy who immediately befriends him and lets him hide in his family's house. The boy's adult sister quickly falls for Trecibi, who charms her with his good looks, constant mechanical noises and childlike innocence, so the siblings try to teach him how to act more like a normal human and blend in. Unfortunately, a black ops assassination squad led by a ruthless, sadistic and foulmouthed man named Hammer is sent to locate and destroy the cyborg, even if it means killing a whole bunch of innocent people just for being in the way.
