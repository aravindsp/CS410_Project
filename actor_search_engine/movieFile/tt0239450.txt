 Ants in the Pants (2000)Summaries A late bloomer, 15-year-old Flo experiences his sexual awakening, relentlessly targeting his gorgeous classmate Leonie. Flos friends eagerly try to help him out. The only problem may be Leonies boyfriend. For years, the ordinary teenager, Florian, has been neglecting his needs, and above all, an impatient but important part of his anatomy. However, his world will turn upside down, when, much to his surprise, Flo wakes up one morning, only to realise that his "best friend" can speak to him. Now, with the talkative "pal" making his existence known on the most unsuitable of circumstances, Flo has no other choice but to enlist the help of his friends who only think about women--Schumi, Dirk, and Red Bull--to be in control of the embarrassing situation. Will Florian manage to impress the school's diva, Leonie? Nick Riganas It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
