 Kamchatka (2002)Summaries The film is seen through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy, Harry (Matas del Pozo), who does not know that Argentina's 1976 coup d'tat is impacting his life. After witnessing the "disappearance" of dissident friends, a human rights lawyer (Ricardo Darn) and his research scientist wife (Cecilia Roth) flee the city and hide from the military police in a vacant summer house. With them are their two kids: Harry, who is fascinated with the escape artistry of Harry Houdini, and El Enano, his little brother. (Translated as "Little Guy" in the English subtitles, played by Milton de la Canal. The actual translation is "dwarf".) The family adopts new identities and attempts to lead a normal life. Later, they are joined by a student who is using the alias Lucas (Toms Fonzi). Their new life is difficult, but a visit with their estranged grandparents (Fernanda Mistral and Hctor Alterio) reveals that they are still a close-knit family. Subtly hinted, however, and used as a metaphor, is the mother's constant smoking and El Enano's renewed bed-wetting. Both serve to show how stressful and precarious their situation is. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka_(film) It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
