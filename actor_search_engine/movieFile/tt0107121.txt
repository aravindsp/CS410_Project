When Einar and the neighbor Bjrn go out with a fishing-boat on the sea, Lene has to stay alone in the cottage overnight. Suddenly her old lover Gaute turns up. He is seeking consolation after the loss of his next sweetheart. During the evening he drinks a lot of alcohol, although Lene warns him against this, knowing that he has a congenital heart-disease. In the morning she finds him naked and dead on a bed. She is seized by panic, and hides the corpse in the cellar. When her husband finally finds the dead body, he is seized with panic too. He thinks no one will believe that Gaute has died from natural causes, and that this story will end his career as a district judge. Einar and Lene try to get rid of the corpse, but problems arise.
