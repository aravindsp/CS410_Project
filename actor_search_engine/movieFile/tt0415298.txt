 Succubus (2004)Summaries A mad scientist schemes to take-over the world in this send-up of 1950's Sci-Fi movies. Fresh from the looney bin after botching an experiement in her back alley sperm bank, a mad scientist dupes a drunken housewife into her dubious scheme of global domination by turning everyone into lesbians with a diabolical "Lezzy" ray. Only a class full of misfits and a mutant blob of sperm can save the day in this spoof of bad 1950's Sci-Fi and scream queen movies. John T.
