 Sorority Boys (2002)44) Strapped for cash, three fraternity playboys make one last attempt to live the high life - cheaply - by masquerading as girls. But their chauvinistic ways come back to haunt them as they get a crash course in the opposite sex. After being falsely accused of stealing the budget for their annual cocktail cruise, three very different fraternity brothers are kicked out of their dorm. In order to clear their name and to secure their future careers, the three dress up in drag and pledge the sorority next door where they learn a few valuable - and hilarious - lessons about themselves and the female species. Three friends who head the Social Committee in a frat house, called KOK (Kappa Omicron Kappa), are charged with stealing money their fraternity has been saving for a cocktail cruise at the end of the semester, the one that guarantees them a spot at a very high paying company. yusufpiskin Three friends who live in a frat house are charged with stealing the money they have been taking for a cocktail cruise at the end of the semester.
