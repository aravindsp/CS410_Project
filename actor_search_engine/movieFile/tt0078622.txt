 Hart to Hart (19791984)Summaries The globe-trotting adventures of amateur detectives Jonathan and Jennifer Hart. Jonathan Hart (Robert Wagner) was a self-made millionaire, the C.E.O. of Hart Industries, a global conglomerate. His gorgeous wife Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) was a freelance journalist. They were both amateur sleuths, and in every episode found themselves up to their eyeballs in murder, smuggling, theft, and international espionage. They also managed to find time to snuggle together, as they loved each other very much. Max (Lionel Stander) was their loyal, gravelly-voiced butler, cook, and chauffeur, and Freeway their pet canine. Marty McKee <mmckee@soltec.net> Jonathan Hart (Robert Wagner), a self-made millionaire and C.E.O. of Hart Industries, is happily married to the beautiful Jennifer Hart (Stephanie Powers), a freelance journalist. They live in a huge estate with their loving butler, Max (Lionel Stander) and have a Lowchen dog named Freeway, who is like a child to Jonathan and Jennifer. One can tell that the Harts, from being millionaires to going around the world, are not your average couple, but another interesting thing about them is that they seem to find murder or any kind of trouble wherever they go, whether it's on vacation or because they're trying to help bail out a friend. According to Max, murder is their hobby. However, as busy as they are, they still find lots of time for love and snuggles in-between, and keep their marriage full of love.
