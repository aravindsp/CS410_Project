 Listen Up (20042005)Summaries Tiny, O-shaped Tony Kleinman and his mate, former professional jock Bernie Widman, still a popular womanizer, co-present a TV talk show in Philadelphia, mainly devoted to sports and athletes of all disciplines. Tony compensates his size by a big mouth, often cleverly phrasing but alas almost as often too quickly yapping, as all too often he only talks himself into more trouble, especially at home, where he faces a well-meaning wife, who happens to be 'always right' more often then a man can stand, especially as she isn't often really wrong, and a tomboy daughter driving anyone to despair, mouthier then him, devious, as assertive and selfish as only spoiled teenage girls can be, and convinced poor devoted dad is the scum of the earth, too embarrassing to take any notice of if it can be helped, and she can get away with an awful lot. Tony's firstborn, Mickey, is a darling boy, and a gifted golfer, but as meek as a lamb, as ambitious as a clam and as assertive as a punching ball: the absolute anti-macho, whose greatest joy is to please people, out of the goodness of his heart.
