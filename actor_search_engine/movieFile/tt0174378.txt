 Becker (19982004)Summaries Dr. John Becker goes through his daily routine of being a doctor, stopping at his favorite diner, and other various situations, all the while hating life and everything around him. Misanthropic Dr. John Becker runs a clinic in New York City. He is assisted by super-capable Margaret Wyborn and less-than-capable Linda, who's only kept on because no one else can stand the doctor. Becker's best (some would say only) friend is the blind Jake Malinak, who runs a newsstand in the diner across the street. The diner used to be run by Reggie Kostas, but it has been taken over by Chris Conner, a lady whom Becker fluctuates between loathing and being attracted to. The diner is also frequented by Robert Benito, who is universally known as Bob and is the super at Becker's apartment (much to the doctor's regret). Thanos6 Ted Danson starred as Dr. John Becker, a dedicated and talented physician with a gruff exterior. Unfortunately, his interior isn't all that warm and fuzzy either. While he offends those around who try to get close to him, he is extremely dedicated to his medical practice in the Bronx where he always goes the extra mile to help those in need.
