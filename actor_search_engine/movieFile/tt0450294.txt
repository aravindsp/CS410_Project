Newlyweds Stephen and Sofia are more interested in checking out each other than the house but that makes for an interesting game of hide and seek with the kids.

What happens over the course of the next 24 hours is a deadly game of survival, with high stakes drama and a a Stockholm Syndrome-style twist that will surprise even the most frequent movie-goers.
