In an ironic twist of colonial fate, this child of the First World is now not allowed to stay in the Third World. With her bags half-packed, she makes a drastic decision. She makes a personal announcement on a local radio station to Cape Town's bachelors: anyone interested in marrying her should meet at the restaurant the following day.
