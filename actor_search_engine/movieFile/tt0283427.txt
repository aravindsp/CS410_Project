 Junior (1984)Summaries Ceil and Enis are a happy if wacky female couple until giant baby son Junior (who sports a mustache but fits in his crib just dandy) develops a fondness for hot dogs and other symbols of manliness (along with many things edible, phallic or not) and decides to bust out of his confining crib to raid the fridge and avenge his overly protective mothers. A high camp low drag tongue in cheek lesbian chicken murder comedy which references everything from other campy classics (John Waters, Kenneth Anger) to the likes of Hitchcock and Sirk. Cheesy fun. (Note: this is put here so folks don't continue to review a DIFFERENT film called Junior by a fellow named Jim Henly--so hey! this is NOT the same Junior) the filmmaker herself It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
