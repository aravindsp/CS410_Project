 9-1-1: Lone Star (2020 )Summaries A New York firefighter relocates to Austin, Texas with his son, where he works to save people's lives while trying to solve his own personal problems. When almost the entire crew of Fire House 126 in Austin, Texas, is wiped out in a fertilizer storage explosion during a fire, Owen Strand of the NYFD is offered the command of the station to rebuild it with an eye for a more diverse crew than the state is typically known to encourage. Despite his early-stage cancer condition and his son's own serious troubles, Strand decides to accept the post. With his sophistication and his ideals in play, Strand assembles a seemingly motley crew of firefighters to handle the various emergencies in his operating area while living with the idiosyncrasies that go with Texas.
