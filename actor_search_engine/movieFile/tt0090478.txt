 Macken (1986)Summaries The local authority wants to close down Roy and Roger's gas station and instead build a motorway where it is positioned. Roy and Roger try to stop it, of course. Will they succeed? Will they find the mysteriously lost white Opel? Per Bratt <perbratt@canit.se> Roy and Roger run the local gas station. All sorts of different people come there with their problems concerning cars and other things. A beige customer sneaks around the station all day, without being noticed, a man keeps demanding his white Opel back, since Roy and Roger have lost it and a mysterious blue Volvo 240 turns up every day, without anybody knowing where it comes from. The authorities want to tear down the station and build a freeway instead, but the brothers aren't too keen on the idea, even though Roy is much more opposed to it than Roger. All is mixed with various songs and funny gags. Anders E Lundin It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
