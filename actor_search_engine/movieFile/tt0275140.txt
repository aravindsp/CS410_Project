 Law & Order: Criminal Intent (20012011)Summaries This series focuses on the NYPD's Major Case Squad, a force of detectives who investigate high-profile cases, whilst also showing parts of the crime from the criminal's point of view to the audience. This show centers on the NYPD's Major Case Squad (and the offbeat, Sherlock Holmes-like Detective Robert Goren) in its efforts to stop the worst criminal offenders in New York. It also puts a new twist to the "Law & Order" formula: now, in each episode, we see the crimes as they are planned and committed. Brian Barjenbruch Every crime has a history, and every perpetrator has a story. Some of them are presented here, as personal tensions develop, crimes are plotted and ultimately executed, sometimes planned, sometimes not, sometimes by obvious candidates, sometimes not so obvious. Whomever the perpetrator or the victim and depending on the severity of the crime in New York City, the matter could be handled by detectives of the Major Case Squad: a force of brilliant and skilled first-grade detectives who handle the most serious and the most complex crimes that New York has to offer. These are their stories. Scott It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
