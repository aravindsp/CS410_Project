 MacGyver (19851992)Summaries The adventures of a secret Agent armed with almost infinite scientific resourcefulness. Macgyver is a secret agent with a difference. He is quiet, mild mannered, deeply principled and refuses to carry a gun on his missions. Fortunately, the last detail is unimportant when compared to his astounding mind. Drawing on a vast practical knowledge of science, Macgyver is able to make use of any mundane materials around him to create unorthodox solutions to any problem he faces. The enemies of world peace and justice continually learn that underestimating this man is a fatal mistake for their plans. Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Macgyver is an enigmatic loner who often finds himself working for an organization called the Phoenix Foundation, the government, or a friend in need. He encounters all types of dangers and escapes from them not with weapons, but with his ability to create gadgets out of everyday objects. His enemies range from militant drug lords and dictators to racist store owners. No matter what he's up against, Macgyver can always defeat his foes with his cunning and his skill. redcommander27 It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
