 All of Us (20032007)Summaries The estranged wife of a television reporter returns to invade his new life. All of Us is inspired by the domestic adventures of entertainment superstars Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith and reflects a new generation's enlightened attitude toward the extended family dynamic with humor, sensitivity and heart. Robert James, an entertainment reporter for a local Los Angeles television station whose best friend is also his publicist, the three-time divorced Dirk. Robert is handsome, smart and a thoroughly modern man in his thinking, as he should be, considering his romantic and parental entanglements. On the verge of finalizing his divorce from the somewhat self-absorbed Neesee, the mother of their endearing five-year-old son, Bobby, Jr., he is madly in love with Tia, a funny, clever kindergarten teacher. This humorous and heartwarming comedy is a fresh, timely look at many young parents' new, compassionate attitude toward how divorced parents raise their children together.
