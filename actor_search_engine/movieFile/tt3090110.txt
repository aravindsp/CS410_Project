 6 Bullets to Hell (2016)Summaries When a farmer's wife is brutally murdered by the ruthless bandit Bobby Durango and his gang of killers, Billy Rogers goes back to his old gun and starts to hunt them one by one. This is a Grindhouse style Spaghetti Western shot and made to look like the classic European Westerns of the 1960s and 1970s - True to the form of how they were filmed in the late 1960s, all the way down to the dubbing of the audio. Enjoy this great throwback to the old style with a brand new story in 6 BULLETS TO HELL! Also enjoy the "Drive-in Style' version with two Grindhouse trailers before the film begins.
