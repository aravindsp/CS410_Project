 Magical DoReMi (19992004)Summaries The misadventures of three little girls studying to be witches. Ojamajo Doremi is the story about a girl by the name of Doremi Harukaze and her friends as they learn magic. Doremi is the main star of the show, for it was her who caused her friends, Aiko and Hazuki to become witch's apprentices as well. Doremi claims to be "the unluckiest bishoujo in the world", so she hopes to one day learn magic, because she thinks it'll make her life easier. She stumbles across the Maho Dou (Magic Hall) one day and calls a woman by the name of Marika (her actual witch name is Majorika) a witch. Because she called out a witch as a witch, she must now train under Majorika's advisory and pass all her witch's exams to meet her goal of becoming a full-fledged witch.
