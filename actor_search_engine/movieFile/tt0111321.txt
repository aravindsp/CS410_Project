 Surf, Sand and Sex (1994)Summaries Six women on a beach tell each other their fantasies. These stories are shown to us as little sex vignettes. The story is held together by a beach party attended by six relatively young women. Claiming that it may be the heat that is making her do it, each woman tells of a sex fantasy that she is reminded of by the situation. Sex with an ex-husband, a man in uniform, and an automobile mechanic are stories that make up half the segments. The other three have to do with unique places where their fantasy trysts occur: in a public place, after hours in a dance hall, and finally, in the mountains.
