 Veronica's Closet (19972000)Summaries Veronica Chase (Kirstie Alley) is the best romance expert around. Unfortunately, her expertise only works on others. After dumping her womanizing husband, she must build back her life and image through her company, and with the help of its employees. Steve Richer <sricher@sympatico.ca> Veronica Chase (Kirstie Alley) owns a lingerie company called "Veronica's Closet". After divorcing her husband of many years when she discovers that he has been cheating on her, she throws herself into her work. She is aided by her best friend, Olive Massery (Kathy Najimy), Josh Blair (Wallace Langham), her secretary whom everybody says is gay, but he says he is not, Leo Michaels (Daryl Mitchell), Perry Rollins (Dan Cortese), and two other employees. At the end of the first season, she took in a partner, but she died and her nimrod son took control of the company and was wrecking it. In the next season, Alec Bilson (Ron Silver), her would-be partner's ex-husband bought the company from his stepson and decided to work with Veronica. And while she didn't like the arrangement, she liked him. In the third season after they had a fight, Alec left abruptly and died in an accident, but before he did, he married a girl named June (Lorri Bagley), who inherited his fortune, which included "Veronica's Closet", and drove Veronica up the wall. rcs0411@yahoo.com It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
