 Young Justice (2010 )Summaries Teenage superheroes strive to prove themselves as members of the Justice League. Within the Justice League, its members' teen sidekicks push for full membership, but it's only after they successfully investigate Cadmus, in which they find and free its secret young clone of Superman, Kon-El (Nolan North), is the League convinced. In response, the League organizes the teenagers into an apprentice team to be both trained and act on behalf of the League at their own pace. Now these teen superheroes, soon strengthened by more members, must battle the forces of evil in their own way, even as the mysterious cabal known only as The Light has a sinister agenda of their own.
