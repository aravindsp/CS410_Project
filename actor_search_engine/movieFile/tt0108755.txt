 Duckman: Private Dick/Family Man (19941997)Summaries A crass, womanizing duck works as a private eye with his level-headed pig sidekick, all the while raising a family as a single dad. Eric Duckman (Jason Alexander) isn't your average suave, sophisticated private eye. In fact, he's rude, ignorant, slovenly, and hasn't had a date in years. With the help of his infinitely more capable sidekick, Cornfed Pig (Gregg Berger), Duckman manages to solve enough cases to cover his alimony payments and cable television bills.
