Anonymous It's been 30 years since the brutal murder of Katherine Blakely in her family's mansion. Now, after years of neglect, the Blakely Mansion is open again, home to seven college students exposing their lives on a new website, "TheCampusHouse.com". But someone doesn't want them there. And on this anniversary of Katherine's death, the killing begins again. A man brandishing a sickle - the same weapon used in the 1971 attack - slices a teenage girl to death in a nearby college dorm. Tensions build in the mansion as the students deal with the news of the murder. Brook, a smart, attractive girl, thinks the original Blakely Mansion murderer is back. Most of the others, however, think she's jumping to conclusions. Ian, a mysterious foreign-exchange student, supports Brook's theories but has a romantic agenda as well. We see Sarah, talking into a grainy web cam, breaking into tears as she talks about how scared she is, how vulnerable she feels. Then there's Drew, the all-American frat boy, posing for the web camera, talking about which woman he'll try to hit on next. Michael Braemore, the ambitious, determined director of the internet show, tries to alleviate his cast members' fears and assures them that security measures have been taken, and that the launch of "TheCampusHouse.com" will proceed as planned the next day. But that night, the man with the sickle finds his way to the Blakely Mansion and continues his murder spree. It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
