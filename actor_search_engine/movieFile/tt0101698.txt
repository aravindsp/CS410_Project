 Defending Your Life (1991)44) In an afterlife way station resembling a major city, the lives of the recently-deceased are examined in a court-like setting. Just after being killed in a car crash, Daniel Miller finds himself in Judgment City, a waiting area for the newly deceased. While there, one must prove in a courtroom-style process that he successfully overcame his fears. Daniel meets Julia in an afterlife comedy club, and falls in love with her. Julia seems to have what it takes to move to the 'next stage' of existence, but Daniel's worried he'll be sent back - and lose the one person he loves so much. Jon Reeves <jreeves@imdb.com> Advertising executive Daniel Miller dies in an auto accident and finds himself in Judgment City. He is taken to a hotel to rest, and the next day he takes a tram downtown to meet his lawyer, Bob Diamond (Rip Torn). Diamond informs him that there is to be a five-day examination of his life to decide whether he has overcome fear. At a comedy club he meets Julia and they fall in love. But as their trials progress, it becomes clear Julia has overcome fear and is moving on, while Daniel seems doomed to go back to Earth. Diana Barahona All one's life is recorded - to make it easier for the prosecutor and your defence representative at Judgement City to access a few episodes to show whether you made the most of the life you just completed. If you hadn't, you're sent back - to try again, until you do get it right. If you've succeeded, you'll move onward - you'll evolve to becoming a 'bigger-brained' being... somewhere. Middle aged Daniel dies in a car crash in the new BMW he'd bought for his birthday. He meets Julia who's also recently died. The 2 begin a courtship and FFA all in love, whilst defending their lives.
