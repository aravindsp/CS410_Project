 Einstein's God Model (2016)Summaries String theory and the afterlife collide as researcher Brayden Taylor embarks on a quest to contact another dimension. An "American Doctor Who", this underground sci-fi film is the first of a series of adventures based on real science. For thousands of years, only religion has offered an answer to what happens after death. Science is about to change that. With the help of a physicist, a blind medium, and Thomas Edison's final experiment, Brayden Taylor embarks on a quest to contact the afterlife. For his love to transcend dimensions, he must defy the laws of quantum physics. He must defy the balance nature demands. He must defy ... the God Model. Philip T.
