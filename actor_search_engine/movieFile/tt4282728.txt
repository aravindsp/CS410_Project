 Whiplash Dreams (2015)Summaries "Whiplash Dreams" is a music-film-first: a feature length drama narrated by 12 original songs. 12 songs describe the final 12 months of a young couple who move from Brighton to London to save their dying relationship. But things don't go the way they planned things rarely do. "Whiplash Dreams" is a rites-of-passage tale of teenage love turned adult heartbreak; a tense, unflinching and provocative exploration of the carelessness of growing apart, and then finally of the courage and pursuit of freedom in the reaffirmation of one's own identity.
