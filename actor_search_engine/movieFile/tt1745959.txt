 The Bloody Indulgent (2014)44) After killing a strip club owner, Burt, an indulgent Vampire with a zest for life hides out at an upscale drug den until strippers seeking revenge and zombies from hell face off for a final showdown. After killing the owner of a B-rated strip club, Burt, an indulgent vampire with a zest for life hides out (and dopes up) at an upscale drug den, until the strippers seeking revenge...and the zombies that come out of no where...all face off for a final showdown. Then he took a dump!!! Anonymous In an attempt to savagely chew the blood out of a B-rated strip club owner named Sid (Brian Gaskill), a skeezy indulgent vampire, Burt (Kevin Richardson), whose zest for "life" is equaled only by his addiction to really expensive, exotic drugs, hides out (and dopes up) at an upscale drug den, owned by a photographer who seems to have grown a dark whimsy of killing herself. Dori, Sid's girlfriends, and the other rather unique and humorous strippers at the club (Diva Zappa, Tracey Leigh, Laura Martin... ) are hell bent on revenge and declare war on Burt. In the meantime, Burt's sidekick Todd (newcomer Brandon Heitkamp) grapples with his new station as a vampire, turned by Burt in a moment of blood-lust, and also grapples with his ensuing bisexuality, a by-product of being turned into a vampire... he thinks. This sexy-violent musical is full of hot dancing girls and boys, drug addled nymphettes, existential zombies and gallons of blood rounding out this French New Wave version of a Pulp Fiction meets Strictly Ballroom romp.
