 Escape Under Pressure (2000)Summaries A car ferry carrying a valuable artifact is sunk by a group of international thieves. Elgin Bates, a billionaire art collector, hires a British sociopath to help him find a priceless, long-lost, storied sculpture. Bates's man unearths the sculpture in Greece, but it's taken from him by Athens customs agents and put on a tourist ship bound for a museum on Lesbos. En route, Bates's hired guns hijack the ship, start a fire fight with soldiers guarding the statue, and prepare to rendezvous with a sub in Bates's hire. On the ship are a scholar and her daredevil husband. She recognizes the statue and grabs it before the sociopath can. With the ship sinking, she and her husband are under figurative and literal pressure to find a way to escape with their lives and the statue. <jhailey@hotmail.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
