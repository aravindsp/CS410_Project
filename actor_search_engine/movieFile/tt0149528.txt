 Stio do Picapau Amarelo (19771986)Summaries At a small house, there at the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch, live an intelligent and tender granny, Miss Benta, the cook Aunt Nastcia, the two cousins Lucia "Little Nose" and Pete. With them, a wise living toy made of maize named Viscount of Corncob by the kids, and Lucia's talkative living rag doll, the smart, rough and somehow magical Emilia, which possesses an immeasurable power of bringing imagination to real only by "pretending". The kids are entertained not only by Benta's fairy tales, but also by her intense knowledge of the world. The farm is surrounded by a pristine jungle inhabited by creatures beyond the imagination - the frightening ones such as the Headless Mule, the Werewolf, or the Will-o'-the-wisp; the naturally correct ones such as the Curupira and Iara, a river nymph - or "mere" ones such as hungry jaguars and hostile wasps (the only ones the brave and bold Pete actually fears). The forest is also home for the demonic, reptilian witch Cuca and her "cousin" Saci-Perer, a mulatto boy-like, one-legged figure that enjoys playing pranks particularly on Aunt Barnab, the farm's closest and sympathetic neighbor. The ranch itself is populated by uncommon, talking animals such a reader Donkey, a docile and tender rhino named Quindim and the greedy, lazy and fat pig Short-Tail, who also happens to be Emilia's "husband". The nearby stream is an actual hidden gateway for a wondrous underwater kingdom to which Lucia creates a bond, particularly to its fish king, the Scaly Prince. In this universe of fantasy and learning, Lucia, Pete, the corny Viscount and Emilia explore different worlds such as Neverland, the Fables Country, the Ancient Greece and even the Moon, traveling by using a magic and powerful powder known as Pirlimpimpim.
