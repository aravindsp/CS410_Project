 Rustlers' Rhapsody (1985)Summaries A singing cowboy roams the Wild West with his sidekick, dancing horse and fancy wardrobe. While the audience watches a black and white horse opera, a narrator's voice wonders what such a movie would be like today. Rex O'Herlihan, The Singing Cowboy, finds himself in color and enters a clich-ridden town, in which the evil cattle baron ( Andy Griffith ) and the new Italian cowboys (who always wear raincoats no matter how hot it gets) join forces to get him and the sheep ranchers to leave the valley.
