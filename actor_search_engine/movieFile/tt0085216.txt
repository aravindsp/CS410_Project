 Bar Esperanza (1983)Summaries A group of eccentric people gather at a popular bar in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, doomed to be closed to give way to the construction of a big building. Intellectuals, artists, and night-people in general join forces to try to stop its demolition. Among its customers are actress Ana; her intellectual-type husband Zeca, in crisis about his work for TV; artists, newspapermen, a female researcher, and a couple who's always quarreling only to be reconciled moments later. lukejoplin@infolink.com.br It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
