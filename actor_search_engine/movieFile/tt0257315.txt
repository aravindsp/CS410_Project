 My Family (20002011)Summaries Ben Harper, a misanthropic dentist, has little time for most people, including his wife Susan, and their children Nick, Janey, and Michael. British comedy series about the Harper family. Father Ben is a dentist who'd like to see his children move out of the house as soon as possible because all he wants is peace and quiet. His eldest son Nick - who later on in the series does move out - is a complete idiot and a no-good who can't hold on to any of the various jobs he has. Daughter Janey is very shallow and not very picky when it comes to boys while son Michael is way too smart for Ben and doesn't feel the need to communicate much with his father. His curious wife Susan clearly makes all the decisions in the household. Later on in the series Ben gets an assistant at work, goofy and naive Roger, and when Janey finally moves out, no-brainer Abby moves in, while Janey keeps visiting, sometimes bringing along her little son, Kenzo. So much for Ben's peace and quiet. Marco van Hoof <k_luifje7@hotmail.com> This is a long-running British sitcom that ran from 2000 to 2011.

Janey Harper (Daniela Denby-Ashe) is a shopaholic, is sexually promiscuous, and is dismayed by Ben. Michael (Gabriel Thomson), Ben and Susan's geeky and highly intelligent youngest son, and has a dark, cynical sense of humor. steelywulf It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
