 Apartment 206 (2003)Summaries Two victims of a traffic accident wake up in a mysterious apartment. Outside is complete darkness. Their only contact with the living world is through old televisions that broadcast the one thing they cherish back on earth. For Sandra, a strong-willed mother, it is her teenage son. For Conrad, a loner from a troubled family, it is the completion of a manuscript that has consumed him. Over the course of sixty years, they evolve from squabbling rivals to nurturing co-dependents and eventually help each other face the dark and move on.
