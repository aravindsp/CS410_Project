 Ohara (19871988)Summaries Crime drama about a wise, elderly, Asian-American LAPD cop investigating crimes with his culturally insensitive and thickheaded but overall good-natured younger partner, Lt. George Shaver. The series focuses on an unconventional Los Angeles-based Japanese American police lieutenant named Ohara who uses spirituality methods such as meditation in his home shrine to solve crimes without the use of a gun or a partner, although he would use martial arts if necessary. He often talked in the form of epigrams. He was later paired with a partner named Lt. George Shaver who was a more conventional cop. It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
