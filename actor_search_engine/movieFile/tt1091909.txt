 Murdoch Mysteries (2008 )Summaries In the 1890s, William Murdoch uses radical forensic techniques for the time, including fingerprinting and trace evidence, to solve some of the city's most gruesome murders. In the late 1890s, police Detective William Murdoch takes a new, more scientific approach to solving crimes.
