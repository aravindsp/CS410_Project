 Atlantic City (1944)Summaries Vaudeville acts are re-created in the story of how Atlantic City became a famous resort. In 1915, Atlantic City is a sleepy seaside resort, but Brad Taylor, son of a small hotel and vaudeville house proprietor, has big plans: he thinks it can be "the playground of the world." Brad's wheeling and dealing proves remarkably successful in attracting big enterprises and big shows, but brings him little success in personal relationships. Full of nostalgic songs and acts, some with the original artists. Rod Crawford <puffinus@u.washington.edu> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
