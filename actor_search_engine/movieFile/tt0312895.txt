 The Last Detective (20032007)Summaries "Dangerous" Davies always gets the cases no one else wants, and no one notices when he eventually succeeds. But his old-fashioned decency and dogged determination have won him legions of loyal fans. He's gentle, old-fashioned, and decent; nice even when he's drunk. But these qualities only earn Detective Constable "Dangerous" Davies the scorn of his fellow detectives in a small London police station. His boss tells him straight out that he's the last detective he would assign to a major crime-solving mission. Unlucky in love, rumpled, and accident prone, Dangerous muddles on and, with the help of his eccentric friend Mod, he proves the merits of his dogged, unglamorous method. He likes being a detective and, occasionally, he gets to do some good. Bye It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
