 In Memory of My Father (2005)Summaries The youngest son of a legendary Hollywood producer, a Robert Evans type, accepts a bribe from his father to document his death. A self-proclaimed (somewhat justifiably) film legend bribes his son to document his death under the unquestioning assumption that it will be historically important. The Result; In Memory of My Father, a twisted celebration of a Hollywood family narcissistically dealing with an eventfully frustrating day, regardless of the subtly distracting centerpiece which they're forced to endure; Dad's corpse.
