Magic Mountain follows the adventures of Lion, Tortoise, Panda and Dragon, four friends having lots of fun with a little Dragon magic thrown in. Tortoise is a motherly figure, always looking out for the others and trying to help them. Dragon lives in a cave, and is very wise, with magical powers that often get the others out of trouble. Panda is a little bit vain, but still a likeable character who is quite smart, and Lion is very playful, full of ideas and is constantly getting into mischief. These four creatures enjoy wonderful times as they invent unusual games, play tricks on each other, and have exciting adventures as they explore their enchanting world.
