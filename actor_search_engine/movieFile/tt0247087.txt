 The District (20002004)Summaries Chief Jack Mannion becomes the police chief of Washington D.C. and cleans up the nation's capitol. Despite having over 30 law enforcement agencies, Washington DC still has the highest crime rate in the US. With politics and indifference being a large factor in this, the city hires Newark PD Chief Jack Mannion, a movie-quoting, lounge-singing former NYPD transit cop who claims he can (and has successfully) cut a city's crime rate in half with his get-with-it-or-report-to-meter-maid-duty attitude, to take over as commissioner of the DC Police.
