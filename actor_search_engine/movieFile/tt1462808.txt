 Mama Chandra (2009)Summaries A moving short story about a clairvoyant running a future-teller enterprise from her front room, whose card reading antics come back to haunt her. Mama Chandra is a charismatic charlatan who reads Tarot cards for living. People come to her seeking guidance and insight into future, in particular when faced with important life decisions: a student who is about to drop out of university; a jealous wife suspecting her husband of having an affair; a failing actor who lacks self-belief. Mama Chandra peddles a mix of pretentious mysticism, motherly warmth and confident assurance, which endear her to a soul-searching clientele. That is until one day, when she receives a visit from someone, who doesn't particularly need any life advice from her. Darius Michael It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
