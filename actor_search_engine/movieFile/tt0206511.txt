 Even Stevens (20002003)Summaries The Stevens family live in Sacramento, California, where the two younger children in the family, Ren and Louis, who have opposing personalities, often clash. Louis Stevens is a maladroit freshman who worships Jay Leno; his older sister Ren is a dean's-list star who plots out the day's coursework with her monogrammed Palm Pilot. Gross-out humor ensues when the siblings scheme against each other to get the upper hand at school and at home. Anonymous It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
