 Ben et Bndict (1977)Summaries Ben obeys, Benedict doesn't. Ben loses, Bndict wins. This is because Bndict just embodies Ben's fantasies. If she was real - Bndict would ask Bernard, a university mate, to offer his name to the child she is expecting. But Ben hangs on a man who doesn't love her, who abandons her.
