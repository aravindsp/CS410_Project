 Twice Upon a Time (2019 )Summaries Vincent and Louise were once very much in love, but they split up some months ago. By chance, Vincent comes into possession of a box which allows him to revisit his time with Louise. Will he get a second chance? Vincent, in his thirties, dreams of winning his ex, Louise, again. He's grief-stricken and driven to despair, kisses the break-up goodbye by nocturnal parties, ephemeral affairs - until this day when a delivery man gives him a parcel he has never ordered.
