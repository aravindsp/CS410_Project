 Moesha (19962001)Summaries A teenager struggles to come to terms with everything life throws at her. "Moesha" is a sitcom (which took more of a dramatic turn in later years) that follows the life of a black teenager living in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, California. For years since her mother's death, Moesha Mitchell has taken care of her father Frank and younger brother Myles. So when a teacher at her school, Dee, marries Frank, Moesha feels her territory being encroached upon by a new stepmother. As time goes on, the two females of the house learn to appreciate and cherish each other. Moesha's boy-crazy best friends Kim and Niecy and eternally-hungry neighbor and pal Hakeem are there to support her through all the drama in her life--and there's always plenty. Andell, a local smoothie-shop owner, is another close confidante of Moesha's, lending her wisdom to the teen when needed. Over the years, Moesha clashes the most with her father, who has difficulty watching his "pumpkin" grow up and often hates her boyfriends, especially "Q." Upon graduating from high school, Moesha attends "Cal U" with Hakeem and Niecy; meanwhile, the entire family struggles with a startling revelation about Moesha's cousin Dorian.
