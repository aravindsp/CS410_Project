 The Brady Bunch Movie (1995)44) The original 70s TV family is now placed in the 1990s, where they're even more square and out of place than ever. Mike Brady and his wife, Carol, have just only one week to come up with $20,000 in back taxes or their house is sold and they'll have no choice but to move. And it's up to their kids to secretly raise money and save the house before they lose it to their scheming neighbor, Larry Dittmeyer. Anthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com> This movie picks up the Brady clan and plops them down in the 1990s, with their original naivete intact. Larry Dittmeyer, their next door neighbor, is in charge of acquiring land for a new residential mini-mall, and they are the last hold-outs on selling their land. Unbeknownst to them, Larry has also been receiving and concealing their mail, which includes overdue notices on property taxes. $20,000 is necessary to save their house from auction, and when their kids find out, they secretly go about raising money to save it. Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> It's the 90s and even the Bradys get the blues. Mike and Carol have just one week to come up with $20,000 before their house is sold to their scheming neighbor, Larry Dittmeyer. To make matters worse, Marcia gets a swollen nose on prom night, Cindy is addicted to tattling, and Jan is hearing a psychotic inner voice crying, "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!"
