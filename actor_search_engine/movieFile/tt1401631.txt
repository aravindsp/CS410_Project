 Slime City Massacre (2010)Summaries In the wake of a "dirty bomb" attack, a New York City neighborhood known as "Slime City" has been evacuated, except for the homeless ("displaced refugees"). Four squatters searching for food in the ruins of the Zachary Devon Soup Kitchen (Jennifer Bihl, Kealan Patrick Burke, Debbie Rochon, Lee Perkins) discover a supply of Zachary Devon's Home Brewed Elixir and Himalayan Yogurt. When they drink the elixir and eat the yogurt, they are transformed into hideous slime creatures driven to murder - an intermediate step as they are possessed by the spirits of Zachary Devon (Robert Sabin) and the members of his Coven of Flesh, who committed suicide years earlier. When a greedy developer (Roy Frumkes) sets his sites on Slime City, he hires a team of mercenaries (Nelron Hubbard, Tommy Sweeney, T.J. Merrick, Eric Mache, and Nicholas John Morgan Anderson) to wipe out the homeless population. It's a battle royal between the Slime Heads, the mercenaries, and bloodthirsty mutant cannibals! A loving tribute to the over the top splatter films of the 1980s, featuring Brooke Lewis, Mary Bogle, and Lloyd Kaufman. Anonymous It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
