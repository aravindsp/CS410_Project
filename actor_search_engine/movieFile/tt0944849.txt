 Who Is KK Downey? (2008)Summaries A failed artist attempts to market his best friend's novel by creating the persona of KK Downey to replace him as the author. Two wannabes decide they're sick and tired of trying to make a name for themselves the old-fashioned way. Terrance is trying to make it as a rock star, while Theo dreams of getting his first book published: 'Truck Stop Hustler,' a racy look at life on the streets as a junkie prostitute. After a string of humiliations by both publishers and music critics, the two hatch a plan to turn Theo's fictional book into an autobiography by having Terrance dress up as the story's protagonist, KK Downey, and claim all the events as having happened to him. All of a sudden the book nobody wanted becomes an overnight literary sensation, and Terrance has realized his dream of becoming famous. But at what price?
