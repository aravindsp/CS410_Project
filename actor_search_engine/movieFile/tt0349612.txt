 Inbred Redneck Alien Abduction (2004 Video)Summaries Aliens meet their match. Abducting a bunch of crazed hillybillies can be a little messy. Government special agents are sent to the hills of Arkansas to investigate an alien abduction. The agents meet and "team up" with some back woods hillbillies to infiltrate the alien's mother ship. Once aboard the spacecraft, hillbillies and government agents alike must fight for their lives and escape their alien foes! It's DELIVERANCE, STAR WARS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and THE X-FILES, all chewed up and spat out as truly bizarre and twisted fun! You'll like it even if you don't own a double-wide!
