 Le retour du fils (2012)Summaries Fifteen years after having been kidnapped by his European mother and taken to Europe, Mehdi, now in his early twenties, determines to return to Morocco without informing her. The decision to go back is provoked not only by the desire to visit his Moroccan father chez lui and see the country where he spent the first five years of his life, but to fill in the empty spaces in his own identity: two parents, two countries, two very different cultures.
