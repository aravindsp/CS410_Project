 The Jersey (19992004)Summaries A group of friends become famous athletes thanks to a magic jersey. A group of friends find an old jersey that, when worn during a sporting event on TV would magically transport the wearer (and sometimes those in contact with the wearer) into a key player(s) in that game. They learn self confidence and team work with the real pros not suspecting a thing. As soon as they score, win the game or take the jersey off are they transferred back home.
