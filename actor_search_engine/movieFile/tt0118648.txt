 The Assistant (1997)Summaries It's the turn of the century and jobs are hard to find. A young man assigns himself the job of a store clerk, without pay, only a place to sleep and eat, after he was manipulated by a hoodlum friend into robbing the man's store. Soon he falls in love with the pragmatic store owner's daughter, who hesitates in giving her heart, or body. Nonetheless, the young man perseveres, much to the chagrin of her strict Jewish mother, who doesn't want her daughter marrying a gentile.
