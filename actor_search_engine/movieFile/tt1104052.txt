But some fates are worse than death. When Jenny Cross (Chauntal Lewis) has to spend summer vacation with deadbeat dad (Stuart G. Bennett) on his creepy commune, she thinks clean living and boredom will kill her. But some fates are worse than death...Provocateur filmmaker Elisabeth Fies masterfully mixes psychological thriller, horror, satire, and coming of age movies to create a fresh, surprising mystery that winks at 1970s masterpieces. The Commune Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. The bastard child of THE WICKER MAN and Greek tragedy, THE COMMUNE is a heady mix of myth and mystery, featuring a young virgin who finds herself isolated in a remote commune of religious "family" members with a sinister agenda to ensure their supernatural survival. Tyro director Lis Fies deftly blends the tragic with the outrageous, painting her feminist motion picture with a bloody, psycho-sexual brush. Haunting imagery and symbolism underscore the horror of entrapment, sacrifice and familial dysfunction as Jenny (Chauntal Lewis) confronts the evil that is her father (Stuart G. Bennet ) and his new family. THE COMMUNE is uncomfortable in the best possible way -- igniting revulsion -- but forcing you to keep watching as its sordid tale unfolds.
