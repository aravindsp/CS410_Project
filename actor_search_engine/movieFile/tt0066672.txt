 Jason King (19711972)Summaries An ex-intelligence agent turned novelist finds himself performing new missions around the world. After leaving Department S, the hedonistic, womanizing dandy Jason King settled down to a full-time career of writing (trashy) Mark Caine novels. He philandered his way around the world, doing research for his stories and tripping over a variety of odd--often verging on surreal--cases, usually involving beautiful women. He was occasionally blackmailed into working for British Intelligence under the threat of being arrested for unpaid back taxes.
