 Polytechnique (2009)Summaries A dramatization of the 1989 Montral Massacre, during which several female engineering students were murdered by an unstable misogynist. On December 6, 1989, a lone gunman walked into Montral's cole Polytechnique (in Canada), a post-secondary institution focusing primarily in engineering, and began a shooting massacre. This event and its aftermath are shown from the perspective of three people. The first is the shooter himself, who blamed the problems in his life on who he considered feminists, such as female engineering students, who were his primary targets. This event was the culmination of a seven year plan, which had a self-defined end. The second is female mechanical engineering student Valrie, who earlier that day had an interview for her dream internship, working on an aerospace project. The interview process itself was a disturbing one for her in the stereotypical view by the male interviewer, who did not believe that females could work in the business and still have aspirations to have a family. And the third is Jean-Franois, Valrie's friend and fellow mechanical engineering student, who was one of the few who did whatever he could to help the targeted women. Huggo On December 6, 1989, a young, armed-to-the-teeth misogynist walked into Montreal's cole Polytechnique, bent on murder. Enraged by feminists, the assailant entered a classroom, picked out nine petrified female students, and opened fire. Incorporating three different perspectives, the film recounts the shocking events of the Montreal Massacre through the eyes of the pitiless killer, who wanted to kill as many women as possible, the Canadian engineer and lucky survivor, Valrie, and her classmate, Jean-Franois.
