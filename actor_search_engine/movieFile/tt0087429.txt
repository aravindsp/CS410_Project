 The House of God (1984)Summaries Follow a group of interns in a large teaching hospital. When Chief Resident Jo has a breakdown, the interns are reluctantly placed under the tutelage of the senior resident, who's known as The Fatman. Like "M*A*S*H," "The Hospital," and "St. Elsewhere," (from which this story draws), this film is closer to the truth than the public wants to know.
