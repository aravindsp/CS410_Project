 No 73 (19821988)Summaries The team moved from the "No 73" house to a Wild-West theme park for the last two series and welcomed a host of new presenters including Rob Debenham as the out-of-work-actor-turned-builder. His natural comedic approach and physical dexterity saw him encounter a number of mishaps such as falling through bathroom floors and other builder-related fiascoes. Saturday-morning magazine show based around a busy house in Maidstone, Kent--No. 73--featuring guest stars, music, cartoons, and fun. Its presenters played characters rather than themselves, adding a subplot to the show each week as various different dramas and escapades were experienced by Kim, Neil, Harry, Dawn, and company.
