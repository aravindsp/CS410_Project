 EastEnders (1985 )Summaries The everyday lives of working-class inhabitants of Albert Square, a traditional Victorian square of terrace houses surrounding a park in the East End of London's Walford borough. The square includes the Queen Vic pub and a street market. Set in the East End of London, the show focuses on the tensions between love and family with stories ranging from hard-hitting social issues, to personal, human tragedies. And there's plenty of funny moments too. Classic characters old and new across thousands of episodes have shared a drink in The Queen Vic, shed tears of despair or joy, sat on Arthur's bench in the Square - and at some point or other they probably crossed paths with Ian Beale. ahmetkozan A British soap that has been running since 1985, about the lives of people living on Albert Square in the fictitious Walford borough of East London.
