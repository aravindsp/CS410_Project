 The Hunting Party (1971)Summaries A ruthless rancher and his gang use extremely long range rifles to kill the men who kidnapped his infidel wife. The rich and ruthless rancher Brandt Ruger keeps his beautiful young wife Melissa like a part of his property, subdued to his will. But one day she's kidnapped by the famous outlaw Frank Calder - just to teach him reading, so he tells her. Calder doesn't know or care who's wife she is. He takes care of her well, and eventually Melissa falls in love with him. But Ruger feels humiliated. Full of hate, he sets out to kill him - and Melissa too, if necessary. Together with his friends and the newest technology in guns, which carry 800 yards, he initiates a battue on Calder and his gang.

In the meantime, the illiterate hardened outlaw, Frank Calder, and his marauding gang of cut-throats mistake Ruger's wife, Melissa, for the town's schoolteacher, and abduct her, unbeknownst to them that no one steals from the powerful rancher. Now, Ruger is after them, knowing that he can take down Calder's men one by one. With such formidable weapons, swift and invisible death comes from afar. Who shall live and who shall die?
