 Le gorille (19901991)Summaries He is young and attractive, witty, strong as a bear, brimming with unusual ideas. Possessing a pronounced sense of justice, he is always in action to bring international criminals to justice: the Gorilla. He is the best agent in the French secret service. Due to his extraordinary abilities, he's only deployed on really special and explosive cases. Whether it's a matter of diamond-smuggling or computer crime, slave-trading or plane hijacks, the Gorilla is always on the spot and makes his mark through cleverness and his original personality. His missions take him all over Europe. He is at home in all European cities, and both popular and feared. His speciality is "undercover" work - penetrating criminal organisations and undermining them from the inside. A task which is as difficult as it is dangerous. Again and again, he gets himself into seemingly hopeless situations which only one man could ever get out of: the Gorilla. In spite of all this, he is not one to forget that life also has its pleansant side. He loves beautiful women and good cuisine. He is never averse to a little romantic adventure. His charm, wit and spontaneity enchant every woman he meets. Even his most fierce opponents admit openly or secretly that this "enemy" is a man of real class.
