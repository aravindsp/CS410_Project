 Murder One (19951997)Summaries Theodore Hoffman is a prominent defense attorney in a prestigious Los Angeles law firm. After successfully defending the wealthy but suspicious Richard Cross in a lurid murder trial, he is now involved in the defense of Neil Avedon. Neil is a famous young actor who has had severe drug and alcohol problems and was subsequently charged with the murder, after Cross was acquitted. This single case will run an entire television season (interspersed with bits from other cases that the firm is involved in). Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> This series centers on a prominent defense attorney, Theodore "Teddy" Hoffman, and his associates. When an actor whose addicted to alcohol and drugs, who always gets into all sorts of scrapes, and relies on Teddy to bail him out, is accused and tried for murder, it's up to Teddy to save him. And Teddy has a lot of opposition, like Richard Cross, another one of Teddy's clients, who not only knew the victim but is a dangerous man. Now the unusual thing is that the trial takes over the whole season. When the show returned for a second season, Teddy, whose personal life was affected by the trial of the previous season, took a leave of absence. The firm needing someone to be at the helm, recruits Jimmy Wyler, who use to work for the D.A. but couldn't get along with him, becomes the new head of the firm. And unlike the previous season, they have more than one client to defend and it doesn't take all season to do it. <rcs0411@yahoo.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
