 Atrocity (2006)Summaries Re-enactment of the controversial 1962 Milgram Experiment. This docudrama re-enacts the controversial Obedience to Authority experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram at Yale University in the early 1960s. In the experiment, test subjects believed they were administering electric shocks to subjects who gave wrong answers to a series of questions. At the behest of the scientist controlling the test, each subject increased the voltage to levels that, had electricity really been applied, would have been fatal. anonymous It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
