 Ricky Martin: Livin' la vida loca (1999 Video)Summaries The video features Ricky Martin performing in a pub with his band and hanging out with a lady (Nina Moric) at different locations, including New York city. One scene shows several women taking their shirts off and performing choreographed dance moves while it rains; this scene coincides with the line in the pre-chorus "She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain". Various snippets of the video seem to merge into each other over the duration of the song. Towards the end of the video, Martin gets distracted by his lady partner while driving, causing him to drive erratically and causing another car to veer and hit a fire hydrant, releasing a fountain of water; this was also the first scene of the video.
