 Screen One (19852002)Summaries Anthology of unconnected movies of different genres. Producer Kenith Trodd was part of a 1984 team brought together to study how the BBC should respond to Channel Four's pioneering efforts in making movies for television and theatrical release. The result was a transition from the earlier concept of studio-made plays, such as Play for Today (1970) and the introduction of the new BBC anthology movie series, this show and Screen Two (1985), with Trodd's supervision of the initial group of titles in 1985.
