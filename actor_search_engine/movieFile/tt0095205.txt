 Bride of the Orient (1989)Summaries After the death of his mother, farmer Windleter feels very lonely on his small mountain farm in Switzerland. Chances to find a wife in the small village are nil - a life with him would mean hard work seven days a week. So he finally "orders" a young woman from Thailand, who grew up on a farm herself, and marries her right away, although she doesn't speak a word of German. Slowly they start to grow together - but his village neighbors won't accept her and treat her like a dirty whore.
