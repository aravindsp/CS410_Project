 Freak (1999)Summaries An orderly from a mental hospital transports a boy (who kills his mother in the opening scene of the movie) to another institution. The boy escapes, and runs into two sisters who are moving across country. He kidnaps the younger sister, and takes her to his old house where he grew up. The orderly and older sister group up, and try to find the little girl before it is too late. John Murdock <renter@earthlink.net> Twenty-five years ago the horror began, deformed and hideous. Now it is about to start all over again, this time even more frightening and blood-thirsty - and uglier! A homicidal monstrosity has just broken out of a maximum security mental asylum for the criminally insane, and nothing can prepare the surrounding countryside for the bone-crushing brutality of his rampage. Into this waking nightmare come sisters Staci and Jodi, innocently passing through town, and Jason, the asylum van driver responsible for unleashing the freak. Amidst all the killings, they could not possibly imagine the unspeakable terror and madness in store for them as they now become the hunted. Fighting for their lives, they end up at the freak's abandoned childhood home for the final confrontation - and he has a lot of gruesome memories to fuel his insane bloodlust.
