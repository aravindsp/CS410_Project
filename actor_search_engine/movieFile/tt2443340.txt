 Motive (20132016)321) A feisty Vancouver homicide detective tracks down the most cunning of killers by trying to figure out the often-unexpected motive to the crime. A Vancouver-based murder has just occurred and been discovered. At the beginning of each episode, not only is the victim(s) identified to the viewer, but also the killer(s). The disparate group of Vancouver Homicide detectives, with help from the Coroner's office, must wade through the evidence which will lead them through the more-often-than-not less-than-straightforward path to discovering the killer(s) and his/her/their motive. Often the motive isn't fully understood by the detectives until they catch the killer(s). One of those detectives, quick-witted, acerbic-tongued Angie Flynn, often has the competing priority of raising her son Manny on her own.
