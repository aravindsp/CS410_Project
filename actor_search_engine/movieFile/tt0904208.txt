ZachMichalik Spoilers The synopsis below may give away important plot points. I started seeing this show from the start when it was already in its 4th season............and now i am cursing myself for being this late to a party that is turning out to be simply awesome. Californication is the story of a down-in-the-dumps writer, moved out of his favorite city (NY) to LA, by the love for his wife (to whom he was actually never married) and his daughter. And what follows next is a laugh riot, sex, nudy shows and much more, that is sure to keep on entertaining viewers of all age and sex.
