Just as Malik is about to reveal the truth about his connection to Saxena, he is shot by Saxena himself, who feigns anger at his daughter's kidnapping. Amit arrives and immediately recognizes Malik as the man who killed Rohit. He tells Raj that on the day of the shooting, Malik was talking to someone named 'Sir Ji' over the phone. Raj finds Sir ji's number in Malik's cell phone and makes a call. When Saxena's phone rings, Raj understands that Saxena was the man Malik called before getting Rohit killed through Malik's phone. On being confronted, Saxena admits that he had committed a crime in front of Sonia and Raj before being arrested. Raj goes home with his family and friends. Sonia tells Raj she loves him and does not want to lose her love again. Raj agrees to the same thing. Sonia and Raj return to New Zealand, taking Amit with them. They get married with the blessings of their family and friends.
