 Two of a Kind (1983)Summaries When God decides to destroy Earth, four angels aim to redeem mankind through a young man and woman with their own troubles. God has had just about enough of mankind's attitude, so He decides that He needs to destroy the planet in the immediate future--unless two particular humans, a struggling inventor and a bank teller, both with quite amateur criminal minds, can save the world. Steve Richer <sricher@sympatico.ca> God throws his hands up at the foolishness of humanity and orders the race destroyed. A trio of bleeding-heart angels strikes a deal with him: if they can find just two good souls, the Lord will allow Earth to survive. Unfortunately, the angels have staked the future of the species on a thieving bank teller and an inventor/con-artist. Anonymous It looks like we don't have a for this title yet.
