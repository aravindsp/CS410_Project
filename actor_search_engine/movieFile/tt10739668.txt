 AvoDezanove e o Segredo Do Sovitico (2019)Summaries "AvoDezanove e O Segredo Do Sovitico" The movie is an adaptation of Ondjaki's novel in which everything happens in a city beyond time and geography, in an unidentified neighborhood, coated in mythological undertones. That is where Jaki lives, in a house full of cousins ruled with an iron fist by grandmother Agnette and haunted by the mysterious figure of Grandmother Catarina. The life of the neighborhood and its upstanding residents revolve around the construction of a Mausoleum for a deceased President. The imposing monument threatens the quiet and modest life of the local residents when authorities announce the demolition of neighborhood houses so the structure may be completed. Jaki and his best friend Pi decide to remove the Mausoleum to save the neighborhood. It is a far-fetched plan. A plan doomed to failure if not for the unexpected intervention of a secretive Soviet man. Joao Nunes It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
