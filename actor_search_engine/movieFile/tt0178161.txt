Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@home.com> Starving French playwright Jules Verne never had a play remain open for longer than three days. One day, one of the doodles he made of a vehicle that can tunnel through the ground ends up being built by a shadowy organization that seeks to keep Europe under the heels of absolute monarchy. He links up with British secret agent Phineas Fogg, his cousin Rebecca, and his valet Passepartout to combat this organization and keep Europe in peace and scientific enlightenment.
