 Harvester (1996 Video Game)Summaries Amnesiac named Steve wakes up in a strange little town called Harvest, a place seemingly straight out of 1950s Americana but with a noticeably eerie and twisted pitch black dark side, that's preparing for the annual festival of blood. Tongue-in-cheek point and click horror adventure game in the form of a violent, perverse and grotesque dark satire on violent video games and the moral panic they cause. A man wakes up one morning in a house he doesn't recognize and quickly realizes he's suffering from amnesia. He finds a rude little boy sitting in front of the TV with his cowboy hat on watching westerns while occasionally saying something negative about the Native Americans. The boy refers to the man as Steve and calls him his big brother. Steve has no memory of the boy but the boy doesn't believe in his amnesia story calling him a big kidder. Steve then meets his mother in the kitchen, a typical 1950s housewife with chauvinist views on the role of women in society. He has no memory of her either, but she insists that he's her son and that he's about to get married to a girl called Stephanie . He visits the girl and realizes she's the only other person in town who believes him, since she also has no memory of how she got there and doesn't recognize anyone there including her family either. Steve soon learns that a festival of blood is approaching and that he needs to join the town's secret society, whose headquarter is a dark tower in the center of the city, before this happens. After some solving puzzles, looking for a missing child and uncovering a string of strange brutal deaths, Steve realizes that he may not like the answers he finds and that the price that must be payed at the end of his quest might be too high. Although the game for the most part uses typical point and click adventure game gameplay mechanics, once Steve enters the dark tower, the game becomes a point and click action game.
