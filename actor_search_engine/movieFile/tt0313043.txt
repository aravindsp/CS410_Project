 CSI: Miami (20022012)Summaries The cases of the Miami-Dade, Florida police department's Crime Scene Investigations unit. Horatio Caine (David Caruso), a former homicide detective, heads a group of investigators who work crimes amid the steamy, tropical surroundings and cultural crossroads of Miami. His team includes Calleigh Duquesne (Emily Procter), a bilingual Southern beauty with a specialty in ballistics; Tim Speedle (Rory Cochrane), a cocky yet disarming investigator who is well connected on the street, and Eric Delko (Adam Rodriguez), an underwater recovery expert who knows all the twists and turns of the Florida waterways. Rounding out the team is Alexx Woods (Khandi Alexander), the no-nonsense, know-it-all coroner. And, after Speedle is killed in action, former Patrolman Ryan Wolfe (Jonathan Togo) joins the team. Together, these investigators collect and analyze the evidence to solve the crimes and to vindicate those who often cannot speak for themselves - the victims.
