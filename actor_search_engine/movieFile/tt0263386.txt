Loner freshman Jake Taylor is forced to join the wildest fraternity on campus when the frat brothers refuse to accept his geeky cousin/roommate unless Jake agrees to pledge with him. As the semester progresses, Jake struggles to maintain his grades as well as his affair with Paige, a beautiful sophomore who hates all fraternities. Through naked scavenger hunts, sorority ass-signings and all night beer fests, Jake discovers that he's actually beginning to enjoy himself. But when both his scholarship and his relationship with Paige are threatened, Jake must swallow his pride and turn to his fellow pledges for help or risk losing everything.
