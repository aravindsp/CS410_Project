 Auntie Lee's Meat Pies (1992)Summaries A devil-worshiping woman sends out her four beautiful nieces to lure men back to her place so they can be killed, ground up and sold as meat pies. Outside the small, one-cop town of Penance, California, Auntie Lee bakes her popular meat pies, with the help of four nubile nieces and the ranch's blood-simple handyman, Larry. The source of the meat for the pies? Men who are passing through, lured to strange deaths by the nieces - Fawn, Coral, Sky, and Magnolia - who smile, show a little skin, and pretend to be playmates. Closing in on the trail of a missing man is a New York private eye, Harold Ivars; plus, the town's cop, Chief Koal, finds Larry's behavior a bit suspicious. Will the cop and the dick bring Auntie Lee's vocation to a grinding halt? <jhailey@hotmail.com> It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
