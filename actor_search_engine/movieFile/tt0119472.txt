 Knockin' on Heaven's Door (1997)Summaries Two terminally ill patients escape from a hospital, steal a car and rush towards the sea. Two young men, Martin Brest (Til Schweiger) and Rudi Wurlitzer (Jan Josef Liefers), both suffering from terminal cancer, get to know each other in a hospital room. They drown their desperation in tequila and decide to take one last trip to the sea. Drunk, and still in pajamas, they steal the first fancy car they find, a 1960s Mercedes convertible. The car happens to belong to a bunch of gangsters, who immediately start to chase it, since it contains more than the pistol Martin finds in the glove box. Armin Ortmann <armin@sfb288.math.tu-berlin.de> Two German men in the hospital's "death row" get drunk. They steal a mob car with a gun and one million Deutsche Marks in it and use them on their road trip to see the sea before dying. The Mob wants its car and money back and chase them, as do the Police. Scott Filtenborg It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
