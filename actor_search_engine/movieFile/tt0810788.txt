 Burn Notice (20072013)Summaries A spy recently disavowed by the U.S. government uses his special ops training to help others in trouble. Michael Westen, a seasoned U.S. spy, is suddenly "burned", i.e. discredited, without any form of procedure. He survives by doing impossible jobs for desperate people in Miami, where his mother lives. Michael is usually aided by his ex-girlfriend Fiona and trusted former FBI informer Sam. KGF Vissers Professional spies don't just get fired like regular people. Instead, they get "burned". And when you are burned, you're exposed and left with absolutely nothing to your name. No cash, no credit, no credit score, no job history, and you're stuck in whatever city the agency decides to leave you in. Michael Westen is one such spy. He was burned and decides to take his revenge on the people who burned him. But in order to do so, he decides he cannot do this alone, so he teams up with people from his past. His former partner Sam Axe, an ex-Navy SEAL who used to rat on him to the FBI and more than enjoys a good cocktail or two. And his on again, off again ex-girlfriend Fiona Glenanne, who enjoys explosives and firearms as much as fashion and yogurt. Together, they take on cases that help individuals throughout the city of Miami, while Michael puts together the pieces of the puzzle about the people that burned him. And they will need lots of yogurt and C4 in order to do so. halo1k It looks like we don't have a for this title yet. Be the first to contribute!
